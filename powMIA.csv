"   Bill Kurtis article on plight of half-American, half-Vietnamese children abandoned by American GI fathers in Vietnam after war.  Says there are estimated 8,000 Vietnamese-American children in and around Ho Chi Minh City.  Some are war babies, but US State Department officials confirm they have received entry-visa petitions for more than 600 children of American citizens who were left behind in confusion of American departure.  Vietnamese Government has been uncooperative in responding.  Some American diplomats speculate children may become 'hostages' in Vietnamese negotiations for normalization of relations with US.  Children and their mothers, ostracized by society, are forced to make living by working in black-market economy.  Children are not allowed to attend school.  Kurtis, describing visit to Ho Chi Minh City, recalls that he was given close to 100 letters by Vietnamese trying to find relatives in US.  Illus (L).

"    To the Editor:  Since the fall of South Vietnam five years ago, American officials concerned with the refugee program have sought to persuade Hanoi to permit the legal emigration of Vietnamese with relatives in the United States. Orderly emigration by air, from Vietnam directly to the United States, would reduce the heavy loss of life among those who now have no alternative but to take to sea in small boats, hoping for some place of asylum.  Hanoi recently has agreed to allow 32,000 carefully screened individuals to leave on regularly scheduled or chartered aircraft.  However, because the United States has not approved the list, Vietnam now plans to unleash a new exodus of ''boat people.''  When the seaward flow of refugees swelled a year and a half ago, our Government waited for many months before sending the Seventh Fleet to assist them. In the meantime, numerous Vietnamese perished.  If many more thousands now die in the South China Sea, it will again be in part because the Administration failed to act in time. CARL H.

"    WORLD NEWS BRIEFS; Racial Unrest to Be Crushed, South African Leader Says  JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (UPI) - Prime Minister P.W. Botha of South Africa warned nonwhites today that the Government would use ''all its might'' to crush racial unrest and end the worst rioting in four years. It was Mr. Botha's first official statement on the week-long rioting that has left at least 32 people dead and 171 injured.  The warning came as black residents of Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage, the scene of violent clashes last week, expressed fears of new riots if the foreign-owned auto companies in the two cities dismissed striking workers.  ''I am not seeking confrontation nor am I seeking violence, but if people choose this above reasonableness, above sensible discussion and above consultation, then the state has no choice - then it will have to use all its might,'' Mr. Botha said on national television.  Peking Says 16 in Hanoi Were Taken From Embassy  PEKING, June 22 (UPI) - China charged today that Vietnamese policemen forcibly removed 16 Vietnamese who had sought asylum in the Chinese Embassy in Hanoi.  The official New China News Agency said the 16 Vietnamese, including 5 women and 6 children, drove through the gates of the Chinese Embassy in a jeep Friday.  ''These Vietnamese told staff members of the embassy that they were no longer able to bear the ruthless rule of the Vietnamese authorities,'' the press agency said. ''They asked the Chinese Embassy to help them emigrate abroad.''  It said the Vietnamese accused the Chinese of engineering the episode. The embassy and the streets around it were cordoned off by Vietnamese security police, the press agency said. No other details were given.  Venezuelan Government Punishes TV Station  CARACAS, Venezuela, June 22 - The Venezuelan Government announced today that it had ordered one of the country's two independent television stations off the air for 34 hours as punishment for violating regulations governing the content of programs.  This is the first time that the Christian Democratic Government of President Luis Herrera Campins, now in power for 15 months, has taken punitive action against a news organization.  The Government action against Radio Caracas Television, a station which reaches the most heavily populated sections of this nation of 16 million, came following the showing Friday of a documentary depicting inhumane conditions in a government center for children and teenagers suffering from psychiatric disorders.  The Government order also said the program showed minors in a way that could be embarrassing to them or to their families.  Security Tightened in Spain After Warnings by Basques  MADRID, June 22 (UPI) - The police tightened vigilance around Spain's resort beaches today after threats by Basque separatists to set off bombs in tourist resorts within 48 hours unless the Government frees a group of imprisoned guerrillas.  During a ''tourist war'' last year, the E.T.A. Basque guerrillas killed seven people and wounded more than 100 others in bombings at Madrid's airport and major railway stations.

Details of the agreement are still to be worked out.  Oman has also agreed to such an arrangement, but Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie indicated this week that there were problems in talks with Somalia.

Dutch Government Survives Censure Vote  THE HAGUE, June 27 (Reuters) -The future of the Dutch Government was in doubt after it narrowly survived a parliamentary censure motion today.  Prime Minister Andreas A.M. van Agt's center-right Cabinet, under fire for its refusal to forbid the sale of oil to South Africa, survived on a vote of 74 to 72 at dawn after an all-night debate.  The embargo would be largely symbolic because South Africa imports little oil from the Netherlands. The Government has said that it favors an embargo but that unilateral action would have little impact. Parliament adjourned today for the summer.  26 Jamaicans Charged In Alleged Coup Plot  KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 27 (UPI) - Twenty-six soldiers were charged today in an alleged plot to overthrow the Government of Prime Minister Michael N.

The police linked some of the shootings to political gang warfare in Kingston's slums.  Bodies of 400 Americans Reported in Hanoi in 1977  WASHINGTON, June 27 (AP) - A former North Vietnamese undertaker, contradicting the Vietnamese Government, said today that he saw the bodies of 400 American servicemen stored at a former prisoner-of-war camp in Hanoi as late as 1977.  Wearing a helmet and a black visor to prevent his identification because of reported threats to his life, the undertaker told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that as late as mid-1977 he worked on American remains at 17 Ly Nam De Street in Hanoi, which once housed American prisoners, who called it the Citadel or the Plantation. He said that from 1969 to 1975 he and his subordinates processed many of the 400 American remains there. He said the remains were stored in wooden boxes with their personal effects and identification.  He said he had worked for the Vietnamese Government since 1958 but was expelled last year because he is an ethnic Chinese.  Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe Jr., director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that the information had been corroborated but that Vietnam had refused to acknowledge that any more unidentified American servicemen, dead or alive, were in Vietnam.

"   , Thailand, Oct. 6   Two United States officials who visited Hanoi for talks on missing servicemen learned something about Vietnamese tracing procedures but otherwise made little progress, sources close to the talks said here today.  Lieut. Col. Paul Mather and James Tulley, who are based here with the Joint Casualty Resolution Center, held working-level talks with Vietnamese officials from last Wednesday to Saturday on the estimated 2,500 Americans missing since the Vietnam War.  The sources said the Vietnamese officials had refused to agree to hold regular talks on the subject, saying their capability had been reduced by budget and personnel problems resulting from what they called the continuing threat of a Chinese invasion.  But the sources were told that the main difficulty was that the Vietnamese felt that the United States was allied with China, and the officials did not want to cooperate in the tracing efforts.

"    ON his first trip to the United States, Robert Vifian particularly enjoyed two dishes: chili and cioppino, a tomato-based stew of Pacific Coast seafood found in San Francisco. And cookies. ''America is the best place in the world for cookies,'' said Mr. Vifian, a Vietnamese chef who owns a restaurant in Paris. A recent 12-day cross-country swing gave him ample opportunity to sample a good many native American specialties as well as American interpretations of the cuisines of other countries.  ''Americans seem to like spicy foods,'' he said with a satisfied smile. ''That pleases me. The French would never stand for it.'' He was amazed at the variety of cuisines served in American kitchens, often several on a single menu. ''We had meals that mixed the cooking of two or three countries. Steak tartare and South American hors d'oeuvres. Fascinating! We can't do that in France. Everything is labeled. As much as I loved cioppino I couldn't put it on my menu. The public is not interested in an American dish in a Vietnamese restaurant.''  Mr. Vifian, who was born in Saigon and joined the rest of his family in Paris in 1968, has owned Tan Dinh, a Vietnamese restaurant, since 1972. In 1974 his restaurant, one of hundreds in Paris specializing in Vietnamese food, was awarded a coveted toque in the Gault-Millau guidebook.  His trip to the United States was sponsored by Ocean Spray Cranberries as part of a campaign to promote new uses for cranberries. Mr. Vifian liked their sweet-sour flavor. He pickled them and used them as a garnish for various dishes. ''I always include something red in my dishes,'' he said. ''In Vietnam red is the color of luck.''  Although the food in Mr. Vifian's restaurant is strictly Vietnamese, he likes to refer to it as ''nouvelle Vietnamese.'' ''I try to make it less complicated, simplifying it so each ingredient can be tasted and appreciated,'' he said. ''I refuse to use flavor enhancers such as monosodium glutamate. I find a pinch of sugar does the trick.'' For him, the temptation to change traditional recipes is almost irresistible, a way to avoid boredom in the kitchen of a 60-seat restaurant that is open for lunch and dinner.  Various types of spring rolls filled with pork or crabmeat and then eaten wrapped in lettuce leaves with condiments such as ginger and coriander are some typical dishes served at Tan Dinh. ''We often wrap foods to keep them moist while cooking and make them easier to eat,'' he said. Entrees are sometimes stir-fried combinations of meat or seafood with vegetables and flavored with a tart, chewy herb called lemon grass or with basil, a purple variety of which grows abundantly in Vietnam. Hotly spiced soups and sweet, soft puddinglike confections often flavored with coconut are also served.  Mr. Vifian's interpretation of Vietnamese food is distinguished by the service of wines. His wine cellar comprises more than 30,000 bottles and includes close to 600 American bottles. ''I think the wines of Pomerol (one of the districts of Bordeaux) tend to best complement my food,'' he said. ''Wine makers order the American wines.''  He noted how few Vietnamese restaurants there were in the United States, especially in New York. ''There should be more,'' he said.  ''Americans should like Vietnamese food. We use more raw herbs and vegetables than the Chinese do and our cooking is often very spicy.  It would be a disappointment to me if Vietmanese cuisine did not become popular here.'' But Chinese restaurants were more popular than he expected and he was surprised at the availability of Oriental ingredients.  Generally, American vegetables and fruits did not impress him. But he liked the corn. ''Corn is eaten in Vietnam - we cook it every way,'' he said. ''We eat it on the cob like you do but brushed with peanut oil and seasoned with nuoc mam instead of butter and salt.'' (Nuoc mam is a highly salted sauce made from fermented fish that is used as a condiment in Vietnam.) ''Our corn is not as sweet and tender as yours,'' he said. ''My mother used to cook it twice as long as they do here, but it's better than in France. The corn in France is terrible.''  While he was in New York, Mr. Vifian prepared several dishes, including a sweet corn and coconut ''soup'' that was meant to be served as dessert. ''Americans would probably find it surprising, but it is typical,'' he said. He also fashioned rolls of marinated beef wrapped in lettuce leaves, skewered and grilled. That recipe follows.  Saigon Beef Rolls  6 ounces boneless sirloin steak or fillet of beef, sliced paper-thin (see note) 1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder (see note) 3 tablespoons peanut oil 1 tablespoon light soy sauce 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon sugar 1 head Boston lettuce 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon nuoc mam (see note) 1 teaspoon grated ginger 1/4 cup water.  1. To prepare this dish you will need small skewers, either metal or Oriental wooden ones. If you are using wooden skewers, soak them in warm water for at least one hour.  2. Toss beef in a bowl with the five-spice powder, one tablespoon of the peanut oil, the light soy sauce, garlic and half a teaspoon of sugar. Allow to marinate 10 minutes.  3. Meanwhile, separate leaves of Boston lettuce and rinse them thoroughly to remove all grit and sand. Plunge the leaves into boiling water just until they wilt. Drain them on paper towels.  4. Wrap one or two slices of the beef in each lettuce leaf, rolling the lettuce and tucking in the ends to make a neat, compact package.  Thread the beef rolls on skewers. Brush them with peanut oil.  5. Mix the lemon juice, nuoc mam, ginger, remaining half teaspoon of sugar and water in a small bowl to make the dipping sauce.  6. Grill the beef rolls on a hot broiler about one minute on each side, turning them once and brushing again with oil. Serve hot with the dipping sauce.  Yield: 4 servings.  Note: 1. The beef must be very tender. Use only prime sirloin steak or fillet of beef. To be sure it is sliced thin enough, do not leave this task to the butcher. Place the meat in the freezer for about an hour, then slice the meat while it is partly frozen.  2. Five-spice powder and nuoc mam (fish sauce) are sold in Oriental food stores.

"    KONG, Aug. 1   The way Hanoi is telling it, Moscow's success in putting a Vietnamese into space is about the best thing to happen to the third world since miracle rice.  Vietnam's first spaceman, Lieut. Col. Pham Tuan, returned yesterday from an eight-day visit to a Soviet space station with a Russian colleague. Bursting with pride as well as propaganda, the Hanoi radio and the Vietnam News Agency have trumpeted the trip to Asian neighbors as an example of what friendship with the Russians can bring.  The United States shared its space triumphs with third-world allies by passing out moon rocks. Vice President Spiro T. Agnew presented one of the first samples to President Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam a decade ago. But in terms of national pride, taking a third-world friend along for the ride may reap bigger rewards for the Soviet Union. At any rate, that is what Hanoi is saying.  In a message to the Soviet leaders, the leaders in Hanoi called the space flight ''an excellent demonstration of the Soviet Union's great and effective assistance to Vietnam,'' which ''proves the superiority of the socialist system.''  Cosmonaut Lauds 'Heroic Vietnam'  After touching down in the steppe region of Kazakhstan, the Soviet commander, Viktor Gorbatko, stepped out of the space capsule with Colonel Tuan and declared: ''I am proud of having flown together with the first cosmonaut of Asia, and it is no other Asian country than heroic Vietnam.''  Colonel Tuan used part of his week in space to beam television broadcasts to Vietnamese audiences that were translated and relayed to other Asian countries. In one broadcast he declared: ''I was deeply moved each time I flew over Vietnam and saw our beautiful homeland. From outer space I wish to send my greetings to our beloved motherland and to thank Vietnam and the Communist Party of Vietnam for having trained me and given me wings to fly into space.''  He went on to note Vietnam's long struggle for independence and reunification and its ''great victories,'' adding: ''Yet, so far, the Vietnamese people have not been able to enjoy genuine peace due to the war threats made by the U.S. imperialists and the Chinese expansionists against the peoples of Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea.'' Kampuchea is the traditional name for Cambodia.  Awards From Moscow and Hanoi  Colonel Tuan's flight was the sixth of a series in which Soviet cosmonauts have taken along a man from an allied country. Colonel Tuan was awarded the Order of Lenin and the title of Hero of the Soviet Union by Moscow; Hanoi awarded him the title ''hero of labor'' and presented him the Ho Chi Minh Order, first class.  According to the Vietnamese Army newspaper, Quan Doi, on Dec. 27, 1972, Pham Tuan, then a MIG-21 night pilot in the North Vietnamese Air Force, became the first Vietnamese pilot to shoot down a United States B-52 bomber. He did so, the paper said, after remembering Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's pep talk to his unit to shoot down more B-52's in order to ''completely smash Nixon's strategic blitz, thus destroying his plot to negotiate from a position of strength.''  Another Hanoi newspaper, Nhan Dan, portrayed the space flight and the Moscow Olympics as examples of Soviet-Vietnamese friendship and cooperation.

"   , Thailand, Aug. 23   A program designed to allow Vietnamese to emigrate to join their families, mainly in the United States, has led to only a trickle of departures and appears to be stymied.  Under the plan, which was laboriously negotiated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with the Vietnamese Government early last year, only 647 Vietnamese have legally left for the United States since October although requests for the emigration of about 60,000 have been made by relatives in the United States. Most of those who left Vietnam flew on a few charter flights organized by the United Nations refugee agency and some left on the weekly Air France flights from Ho Chi Minh City, formerly called Saigon.  No United Nations flight has left Vietnam in almost a year. The protracted negotiations between Washington and Hanoi to allow American consular officials to examine applicants in Ho Chi Minh City are stalled, and the only American assigned to the United Nations High Commissioner to screen applicants left Hanoi this month after an eight-month stay without being allowed to visit Ho Chi Minh City.  Blame Is Put on Hanoi  Although American officials here concede that cumbersome United States immigration procedures have not facilitated the task and that bureaucratic mixups have occurred, they and United Nations aides, speaking privately, blame Hanoi, saying it has used the issue to pursue its larger political goals.  The program was negotiated by the United Nations shortly before the outflow last summer of the so-called boat people, mainly ethnic Chinese forced to leave by the Vietnamese authorities. When international pressure, culminating in the Geneva conference of July 1979, caused Vietnam to promise to halt the flow, it tried to get rid of the Chinese by grafting them onto the orderly departure program.  Hanoi subsequently proposed 30,000 names for family reunification under the United Nations program, almost all ethnic Chinese from Cholon, the former South Vietnamese capital's Chinese quarter.  Checked by computer against the names submitted by relatives in the United States, only 74 of the 30,000 appeared to have any ties to Vietnamese in the United States. A recheck turned up 70 more who might have a claim for admission.  Drive for Diplomatic Ties  The lists of names Hanoi submitted appeared to be the result of a block-by-block registration of inhabitants of Cholon, an American official with long experience in Vietnam said. An informant recently returned from Ho Chi Minh City reported that it was common knowledge that many of the people on the lists were ethnic Chinese who had paid the Vietnamese authorities to be expelled but were prevented from leaving after the Geneva conference.  Vietnam is also accused of using the family-reunification program to press the United States for diplomatic relations. After apparently agreeing to accept temporary visits by American consuls assigned to the embassy in Bangkok to screen applicants in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi declared that such consuls could visit only when there was an American embassy in Vietnam.  The compromise of having American officials work in Ho Chi Minh City as members of the United Nations refugee body led to the assignment of the American who was prevented from performing his task. No replacement has been named.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 24 1980 ,0

Bruce Beauchamp of Garden Grove, the suburb where the incident occurred.  ''We have not had that many reports of gang activity,'' Sergeant Beauchamp said. ''Whether it's because the people in the community are hesitant to talk with us, we're not positive.''  Gangs Operate in Two Counties  Garden Grove is in Orange County, which has an Indochina population officially estimated at 18,000 and unofficially put at 35,000. Its neighbor to the north, Los Angeles County, has an estimated 110,000 Indochina residents.  In both counties, the police and members of the Vietnamese community report gang activity but differ on how serious the problem is. Other Indochina minorities apparently are not involved.  Although no one claims to know how many gangs there are, there is agreement on the characteristics of the groups: They are composed of single men, 19 to 25 years old, many with training as soldiers in Vietnam.  The members of the gangs wear no uniforms and are loosely organized around older, more sophisticated leaders. Their activities tend to be the extortion of ''protection'' money from businesses rather than gang wars. And rather than claiming a turf, or specific area as its own, a gang may draw members from both counties.  Occasional Fights With Chinese  The gangs operate where Indochinese Americans live, chiefly in central Orange County from Westminster to Anaheim. In Los Angeles, the gangs frequent Chinatown, where Vietnamese of ethnic Chinese descent sometimes fight with Chinese gangs.  The gangs' names are descriptive. The Lun gang is made up of members who are short in stature, and its name comes from a word that means ''short'' in Vietnamese. The Frogmen has members who reputedly are former underwater demolition experts for the Vietnamese Army.  Joe Marcel of the Indochina Social Service Project in Los Angeles said gang members are motivated by loneliness and depression.  Mr. Marcel, a Vietnamese who adopted a French name while living in Paris, said gang members rarely become as violent as they did in the restaurant incident. But Detective Joe Bryan of Anaheim said he has heard of retaliatory beatings.  Possibility of Violence Raised  ''If nothing changes, one day they could become dangerous because they do have experience with violence,'' said Mr. Marcel. ''They are very well-trained as soldiers.''  Mr. Bryan said the police have trouble combating the gangs because of problems gaining the confidence of the Vietnamese community. He added: ''It's a subtle culture. We probably will never get a handle on it, not in this generation.''  Randy Quan of the Los Angeles Police Department's Asian Task Force said the police use Chinese officers to prosecute Chinese and Vietnamese-Chinese gangs. He said the threats made by gang members are very subtle, saying that ''if it's literally translated in a court of law, it doesn't mean the same thing.''  Officials said there is a danger that the gangs may join organized crime. But many believe the gangs will disappear as members find a constructive place in society.  Mr. Marcel said: ''The more training programs we have, the less problems we have. I don't see them as a bad part of society, but they are too active and don't have enough to do. ''If we approach them right, they could make a good contribution to this country. They are young, they have energy. They need to learn to use that energy.''

"    To the Editor:  There is a bold, significant international move that the new Reagan Administration should take which will be practical and constructive: normalize relations with Hanoi. By persisting in its refusal to do this, the United States perpetuates world tensions and problems. Further, we are acting against our own national selfinterest.v.hat could normalization mean?  Economically, American business would get a chance to trade profitably in Vietnam, just as our allies do.  On the humanitarian level, a normalized American presence in Vietnam could help lead to improved conditions for people in Indochina. They need food and technology. We have both. They don't, in part because we destroyed much of what they had.  Morally, we have an unfulfilled obligation to the people of Indochina. The United States, the country most conspicuously present in Vietnam's destruction, is the nation most conspicuously absent during reconstruction. By refusing to normalize relations, we continue the legal banning of trade, aid, development and exchange programs. We thus make the rebuilding process even harder. Certainly we should help those who flee Indochina. But we should also try to restore the shattered society they are fleeing.  The arguments presented by Daniel C. Arnold and R. Sean Randolph (''Don't Recognize Hanoi,'' Op-Ed Dec.23) are similar to the negative rhetoric voiced by the old China lobby before Richard Nixon chose to alter our policy toward Peking. Messrs. Arnold and Randolph contend that our continuing not to recognize Hanoi contributes to ''geopolitical balance'' and serves our interest in a ''stable, secure Southeast Asia.'' The opposite seems more accurate: our policy contributes to instability and imbalance.  Politically, normalization could diminish Vietnam's great dependence on the Soviet Union, thus readjusting the balance of power more in our favor in Southeast Asia. It could also help prevent further conflict between China and Vietnam. The Chinese are less likely to reinvade Vietnam if their American friends are on good terms with Hanoi. The Chinese need what America now provides, in terms of trade and geopolitics, and are unlikely to give up these advantages if the U.S. chooses to recognize Hanoi.  Not all of Indochina's misery today is Hanoi's fault. In recent years our policy has been to ''squeeze'' Vietnam, to isolate it, perhaps even to help make conditions worse there than that tragic nation would otherwise have endured. It seems clear that Vietnam dominates Laos and Kampuchea now, as it has over the centuries. But to use that as an argument against normalization in 1981, or as a reason to back the genocidal Pol Pot, only fosters continued unrest. Normalization would help signal to China that we will no longer bolster its murderous ally.  The Indochina war was, is and will be a bitter experience for many Americans. Someday we will have to come to terms with what we did there. Candidate Reagan declared our role in that war ''a noble cause.'' President Reagan should consider an even more noble cause - peace. The war is over. Let the peace begin. And that means normalization of relations with Hanoi.

"    When the Communists took over North Vietnam in 1954, a million refugees fled to the South. I personally heard stories of their incredible suffering. But, along with other South Vietnamese, I refused to believe them. A generation later, I could not believe Solzhenitsyn's book ''The Gulag Archipelago,'' either. I dismissed it as anti-Communist propaganda. But by 1979, I had published my own book, ''The Vietnamese Gulag.'' Can those who have suffered the horror of Communism ever convince those who have not experienced it?  From 1945, when I was born in the village of Caivon in Vinh Long province, 100 miles south of Saigon, until I left Vietnam in May 1978, I never enjoyed peace. My family's house was burned three times in the war against the French. To escape the fighting, my parents moved from one village to another throughout my youth. Like the majority of Vietnamese patriots, they joined the resistance forces fighting the French. As I grew up, I myself saw how the peasants were oppressed by the local officials of the successive Saigon regimes, how they were victimized by the French bombardments. I learned the history of my country's thousand-year struggle against Chinese occupation and its century-long effort against Western domination. With this background, my compatriots and I grew up with a hatred of foreign intervention.  When the students at Saigon University elected me vice president of the Saigon Student Union in 1969 and 1970, I participated in the different peace efforts, leading student demonstrations against the Thieu regime and against American involvement. I published a magazine called Self-Determination, and traveled in January 1971 to California to give antiwar lectures at Berkeley and Stanford. For my activities, I was arrested and jailed many times by the Thieu Government.  During that period, I believed that I was fulfilling my commitment to peace and the independence of my country. I had faith, too, in the program of the National Liberation Front (N.L.F.), which led the revolutionary resistance in South Vietnam. I hated Saigon's rulers, men like Gen. Nguyen Van Thieu, Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky, Gen. Dang Van Quang - former soldiers of the French colonial army. These were the men whom the French had recruited in the 1940's to help destroy the Vietnamese resistance. They had risen over the years to become leaders themselves, but they commanded no respect from the people.  Because of their lack of popular support, they were predisposed to rely on foreign forces.  As a student leader, I felt I had to pursue the aspiration of the Vietnamese people for democracy, freedom and peace. Naively, I believed that the Hanoi regime at least had the virtue of being Vietnamese, while the Americans were foreign invaders like the French before them. Like others in the South Vietnamese opposition movements, I believed that our Communist compatriots in the North would be more amenable to compromise and easier to work with than the Americans. Moreover, I was hypnotized by the personal sacrifices and devotion the Communist leaders had demonstrated. Ton Duc Thang, former President of North Vietnam, for example, had been imprisoned for 17 years in a French jail. I was hypnotized also by the political programs advocated by the N.L.F., which included a domestic policy of national reconciliation, without risk of reprisal, and a foreign policy of nonalignment. Finally, I was influenced by progressive movements throughout the world and by the most prestigious intellectuals in the West. My impression was that during the 1960's and early 70's the leaders of the American peace movement shared my convictions.  These convictions endured through the signing of the 1973 Paris peace accords and the subsequent collapse of the South Vietnamese Government two years later. When liberation was imminent, I was the one who told friends and relatives not to flee. ''Why do you want to leave?'' I asked. ''Why are you afraid of the Communists?'' I accepted the prospect of enduring hardships to rebuild my country and I decided to stay in Vietnam and continue working as a branch manager at a Saigon bank, where I had been for more than four years, writing secret reports about the economic situation in South Vietnam for the N.L.F. (After leaving the university, I had not been drafted by the South Vietnamese Government because I was the only son in my family.  And I had not joined the Vietcong because the N.L.F. felt I could serve a more useful role providing financial reports from the bank.)  Several days after Saigon fell, the Provisional Revolutionary Government, formed by the N.L.F., asked me to join the finance committee, a group of intellectuals whose job it was to advise the Government on matters of economic policy. I complied willingly, taking a pay cut of 90 percent. My first assignment was to help draw up a plan for confiscating all the private property in South Vietnam. Shocked, I proposed that we should expropriate only the property of those who had cooperated with the former regime and those who had used the war to become rich, and that we distribute it in some fashion to the poor and to the victims of the war, Communist and non-Communist alike. My proposals, of course, were rejected. I was naive enough to think that the local cadres were mistaken, that they misunderstood the good intentions of the Communist Party leaders. I had many fights with them, believing as I did Hanoi's previous statement that ''the situation in the South is very special and different from that of North Vietnam. '' A few months before the liberation of Saigon, Le Duan, the First Secretary of the Communist Party, had said, ''The South needs its own policy.''  In the end, I could not obey the order to help arrange the confiscation of all private property, a plan that was subsequently carried out. Such a scheme had nothing to do with fulfilling the aspirations of the South Vietnamese, and it went against my conscience. I decided to resign. But no one resigns in a Communist regime. The implication of nonconformity is intolerable to Communists. When I submitted my resignation, the chief of the finance committee warned me that my action ''would only serve as propaganda to excite the people; here we never do it that way.'' Several days later, while I was attending a concert at the great National Theater (formerly the National Assembly Hall, which my fellow students and I had occupied so many times under the Thieu regime), I was arrested.  No charges were made, no reasons were given.  After the fall of Saigon, many progressive intellectuals and former antiwar-movement leaders believed that the new Vietnamese regime would bring internal democracy and freedom from foreign domination. They believed that the new regime would pursue the best interests of the people, honoring its promise to carry out a policy of national reconciliation without fear of reprisal. Far from adhering to their promises, the Vietnamese rulers have arrested hundreds of thousands of individuals - not only those who had cooperated with the Thieu regime but even those who had not, including religious leaders and former members of the N.L.F.  Vietnam today is a country without any law other than the arbitrary directives of those in power. There is no civil code.  Individuals are imprisoned without charges and without trial. Once in jail, prisoners are taught that their behavior, attitude and ''good will'' are the key factors in determining when they may be released -whatever crimes they may have committed. As a consequence, prisoners often obey the guards blindly, hoping for an early release. In fact, they never know when they may be released - or when their sentences may be extended.  How many political prisoners are there in Vietnam today? And how many of them have died in prisons during the first six years of Communist rule? Nobody can know the exact numbers. The United States Department of State has said there are from 150,000 to 200,000 prisoners; Vietnamese refugees estimate about one mil lion. Hoang Huu Quynh, an intellectu-al, a graduate of Moscow University, who served as a director of a technical school in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), recently defected to France during his Governmentsponsored tour of European countries. He told the French press: ''There are at least 700,000 prisoners in Vietnam today.'' Another witness, Nguyen Cong Hoan, a former member of the reunified National Assembly, which was elected in 1976, who escaped by boat in 1978, said that he himself knew ''about 300 cases of executions'' in his own province of Phu Yen. In 1977, officials in Hanoi insisted that only 50,000 people, who posed the greatest threat to national security, had been arrested. But Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said, in the French magazine Paris Match, on Sept. 22, 1978, ''In over three years, I released more than one million prisoners from the camps.'' One wonders how it is possible to release more than a million after having arrested only 50,000.  When I was arrested, I was thrown into a three-foot-by-six-foot cell with my left hand chained to my right foot and my right hand chained to my left foot. My food was rice mixed with sand. When I complained about the sand, the guards explained that sand is added to the rice to remind prisoners of their crimes. I discovered that pouring water in the rice bowl would make the sand separate from the rice and sink to the bottom. But the water ration was only one liter a day for drinking and bathing, and I had to husband it carefully.  After two months in solitary confinement, I was transferred to a collective cell, a room 15 feet wide and 25 feet long, where at different times anywhere from 40 to 100 prisoners were crushed together. Here we had to take turns lying down to sleep, and most of the younger, stronger prisoners slept sitting up. In the sweltering heat, we also took turns snatching a few breaths of fresh air in front of the narrow opening that was the cell's only window. Every day I watched my friends die at my feet.  In March 1976, when a group of Western reporters visited my prison, the Communist officials moved out all the prisoners and substituted North Vietnamese soldiers. In front of the prisons, one sees no barbed wire, no watchtowers, only a few policemen and a large sign above the entrance that proclaims Ho Chi Minh's best-known slogan: ''Nothing Is More Precious Than Liberty and Independence.'' Only those detained inside and those who guard them know what kind of place is hidden behind that sign. And every prisoner knows that if he is suspected of planning to escape, his fellow inmates and relatives at home will be punished rather than he himself.  We will never know precisely the number of dead prisoners, but we do know about the deaths of many well-known prisoners who, in the past, never cooperated with President Thieu or the Americans: for example, Thich Thien Minh, the strategist of all the Buddhist peace movements in Saigon, an antiwar activist who was sentenced to 10 years in jail by the Thieu regime, then released after an outpouring of protest from Vietnamese and antiwar protesters around the world. Thien Minh died in Ham Tan prison after six months of detention in 1979. Another silent death was that of the lawyer Tran Van Tuyen, a leader of the opposition bloc in the Saigon Assembly under President Thieu. This well-known activist died in Communist hands in 1976, although as late as April 1977, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong was telling French reporters that Tuyen was alive and well in a re-education camp. One of the greatest losses has been that of the famous Vietnamese philosopher Ho Huu Tuong. Tuong, a classmate of Jean-Paul Sartre's in Paris in the 1930's, was perhaps the leading intellectual in South Vietnam. He died in Ham Tan prison on June 26, 1980. These men were arrested, along with many others among the most prominent and respected South Vietnamese, in order to pre-empt any possible opposition to the Communists.  Some American supporters of Hanoi have ignored or rationalized these deaths, as they have the countless other tragedies that have befallen Vietnam since 1975. It is more than likely that they will continue to maintain their silence in order to avoid the profound disillusionment that accepting the truth about Vietnam means for them. Yet if liberty and democracy are worth struggling for in the Philippines, in Chile, in South Korea or in South Africa, they are no less worth defending in Communist countries like Vietnam. Everyone remembers the numerous demonstrations protesting United States involvement in Vietnam and the war crimes of the Thieu regime. But some of those people who were then so passionately committed to democratic principles and human rights have developed a strange indifference now that these same principles are under assault in Communist Vietnam. For example, one antiwar activist, William Kunstler, refused to sign a May 1979 open letter to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in which many former antiwar activists, including Joan Baez, protested Hanoi's violations of human rights. Kunstler said, ''I don't believe in criticizing socialist governments publicly, even if there are human-rights violations,'' and, ''The entire Baez campaign may be a C.I.A. plot.'' This statement reminds me of the argument used by the Thieu regime to suppress opposition: ''The peace movements and the opposition activists are all the Communists' lackeys.''  There are other illusions about the current regime in Vietnam about which people should be disabused. Many people believed that Ho Chi Minh was primarily a nationalist and that the Vietnamese Communists were and are independent of the Soviet Union. I believed the same before they took over South Vietnam. But portraits of Soviet leaders now adorn public buildings, schools and administrative offices throughout ''independent Vietnam.'' In contrast, one never saw pictures of American leaders even during the so-called puppet regime of President Thieu. The degree of subordination the present Government feels toward its Soviet patron is suggested by a famous poem by the well-known Vietnamese poet To Huu, a member of the Politburo and president of the Communist Party Committee of Culture.  Here we have an opportunity to listen to a high-ranking Vietnamese weep on the occasion of Stalin's death: Oh, Stalin! Oh, Stalin!  The love I bear my father, my mother, my wife, myself It's nothing beside the love I bear you, Oh, Stalin! Oh, Stalin!  What remains of the earth and of the sky!  Now that you are dead.  It may seem incredible that such a poem could have been written in Vietnam, which is known for the strength of its family traditions and its feeling for filial piety. Yet this poem occupied a prominent place in a major anthology of contemporary Vietnamese poetry recently published in Hanoi.  Moreover, Le Duan, First Secretary of the Communist Party, said in his political report to the reunified National Assembly in 1976: ''The Vietnamese revolution is to fulfill the internationalist duty and the international obligation,'' and to do so, in the words of the 1971 party platform, ''under the leadership of the Soviet Union.'' The glorification of Soviet life is, in fact, a major goal of Communist Vietnam's censorship policy.  Immediately after the fall of Saigon, the Government closed all bookshops and theaters. All books published under the former regimes were confiscated or burned. Cultural literature was not exempt, including translations of Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Dale Carnegie. Margaret Mitchell's ''Gone With the Wind'' was on the list of decadent literature as well. The new regime replaced such books with literature designed to indoctrinate children and adults with the idea that the ''Soviet Union is a paradise of the socialist world.''  Another argument made at times by Western apologists has to do with freedom of religion in Vietnam. One article in the new Constitution of Vietnam, adopted this year, declares that ''the regime respects the liberty of the believers and also the liberty of the nonbelievers.'' In regard to this article, Le Duan has repeatedly proclaimed: ''Our present regime is a million times more democratic than any other in the world.'' The reality, though, is suggested by an incident involving the desecration of a Buddhist pagoda, in which a nude woman, on orders from the Government, entered the pagoda during a worship service. When Thich Man Giac, a prominent Buddhist leader, protested, the Government used the opportunity to try to discredit the Buddhists as enemies of democracy -specifically, of the freedom to disbelieve. Thich Man Giac, who had served as liaison between the Buddhists and the Communist Government, escaped Vietnam by boat in 1977 and is now living in Los Angeles.  All of those who supported the N.L.F. in its struggle should be aware of how they were betrayed and deceived. When Harrison Salisbury ofvisited Hanoi in December 1966, the leaders in Hanoi told him: ''The direction of the struggle in the South is by the South and not by the North.'' Pham Van Dong, Prime Minister, said to Salisbury: ''No one in the North had this stupid, criminal idea in mind'' that the North wanted to annex the South.  Yet in a victory-day celebration speech made on May 19, 1975, Le Duan said, ''Our party is the unique and single leader that organized, controlled and governed the entire struggle of the Vietnamese people from the first day of the revolution.'' In his political report to the reunified National Assembly in Hanoi on June 26, 1976, Le Duan said: ''The strategic task of the revolution in our country in the new stage is to achieve the reunification of our homeland and to take the whole country rapidly, vigorously and steadily to socialism, and Communism.''  In 1976, the Provisional Revolutionary Government formed by the N.L.F. was abolished, and South and North Vietnam were reunified under Commu-nist rule. Today, among 17 members of the Politburo and 134 members of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Communist Party, not a single one is from the N.L.F. (there are several members who had been North Vietnam Communist Party representatives with the N.L.F.). Even Nguyen Huu Tho, former chairman of the N.L.F., holds only the post of acting President of State, a ceremonial position that involves greeting visitors and participating in festivals. But his position will be abolished under the new Constitution.  Listen to Truong Nhu Tang, 57 years old, a founder of the N.L.F., former Justice Minister of the Provisional Revolutionary Government, more recently one of the boat people. Tang escaped in November 1979 and is now living in Paris. He told reporters of his experience in a news conference in Paris in June 1980. Twelve years earlier, he said, when he had been jailed by the Thieu regime for his Communist activities, his father came to visit. ''Why,'' he asked Tang, ''have you abandoned everything - a good job, a rich family - to join the Communists? Don't you know that the Communists will betray you and persecute you, and when you finally understand, it will be too late to wake up?'' Tang, an intellectual, answered his father: ''You would do better to keep quiet and accept the sacrifice of one of your sons for democracy and our country's independence. ...''  After the Tet offensive in 1968, Tang was exchanged for three American colonels who had been prisoners of war held by the Vietcong; then he vanished into the jungle with the N.L.F. He had visited many Communist and third-world countries on behalf of the N.L.F. during the war. Tang said in his news conference: ''I was well aware that the N.L.F. was a Communist-dominated national united front and I was naive enough to believe that Ho Chi Minh and his party would place national interests above ideology and would place the interest of the Vietnamese people above the party's. But the people and I were wrong.''  Truong Nhu Tang told of his own knowledge of the way Communist ruling circles operate: ''The Communists are expert in the arts of seduction and will go to any length to woo you over to their side, as long as they don't control the Government. But once they are in power they suddenly become harsh, ungrateful, cynical and brutal.'' Tang summarized current conditions in Vietnam: ''The family is divided, society is divided, even the party is divided.''  Looking back now on the Vietnam war, I feel nothing but sorrow for my own naivete in believing that the Communists were revolutionaries worthy of support. In fact, they betrayed the Vietnamese people and deceived progressives throughout the world. The responsibility for the tragedies that have engulfed my compatriots is mine. And now I can only bear witness to this truth so that all former supporters of the Vietcong may share their responsibility with me.  While I was in jail, Mai Chi Tho, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, addressed a selected group of political prisoners. He told us: ''Ho Chi Minh may have been an evil man; Nixon may have been a great man. The Americans may have had the just cause; we may not have had the just cause. But we won and the Americans were defeated because we convinced the people that Ho Chi Minh is the great man, that Nixon is a murderer and the Americans are the invaders.'' He concluded that ''the key factor is how to control people and their opinions. Only Marxism-Leninism can do that. None of you ever see resistance to the Communist regime, so don't think about it. Forget it. Between you - the bright intellectuals - and me, I tell you the truth.''  And he did tell us the truth. Since 1978, the Vietnamese Communists have occupied Laos, invaded Cambodia and attacked Thailand, while the Soviet Union has invaded Afghanistan. In each of these depredations, the Communists have portrayed themselves, incredibly, as liberators, saviors and bulwarks against foreign aggression. And each time, world opinion has remained relatively quiescent.  But in Vietnam, people often remark: ''Don't believe what the Communists say, look instead at what they have done.'' One South Vietnamese Communist, Nguyen Van Tang, who was detained 15 years by the French, eight years by Diem, six years by Thieu, and who is still in jail today, this time in a Communist prison, told me: ''In order to understand the Communists, one must first live under a Communist regime.'' One rainy evening in Saigon's Le Van Duyet prison, he told me: ''My dream now is not to be released; it is not to see my family. My dream is that I could be back in a French prison 30 years ago.'' This is the one wish of a 60-year-old man who has spent his entire adult life in and out of prison fighting for the freedom and the independence of his country. At this moment, he may already have died in his cell or have been executed by the new rulers.  The Vietnamese people wish to achieve the real revolution; they do not want Communism. The measure of popular hatred for the Communists is that thousands of Vietnamese have abandoned their historical attachment to the land. Under French colonial domination, throughout the long war years, even during the catastrophic famine of 1945 when two million starved to death, Vietnamese simply did not willingly leave their homeland - the land of their ancestors' graves. The recent outpouring of refugees is a direct result of the terror of the present regime. Listen to another refugee, Nguyen Cong Hoan, former N.L.F. agent and member of the new unified Assembly elected in 1976: ''This current regime is the most inhuman and oppressive (Vietnam) has ever known.'' Hoan escaped by boat in 1977, after abandoning his position in the Communist Assembly. ''The Assembly,'' he declared, ''is a puppet, the members know only how to say yes, never how to say no.''  Among the boat people who survived, including those who were raped by pirates and those who suffered in the refugee camps, nobody regrets his escape from the present regime. I am confident that the truth about Vietnam will eventually emerge. It is already available to those who wish to know it. As Solzhenitsyn has said, ''Truth weighs as heavy as the world.'' And Vietnam is a lesson in truth.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Illustrations: photos                      ",March 29 1981 ,1

"    To the Editor:  Gareth Porter's advocacy of accommodation with the Vietnamese (Op-Ed Nov. 11) fundamentally conflicts with the realities of Indochina. North Vietnamese imperialism, first directed at South Vietnam and Laos and then at Cambodia, remains the basic problem in Indochina, and such imperialism only understands the language of force.  he Hanoi regime, which has driven hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese people to their death on the high seas or in concentration camps, really cared nothing for the plight of the Cambodians under Pol Pot, whom it installed in power. Instead, Hanoi, in tandem with Moscow, has proceeded to set up its own Marxist empire in Indochina, the Soviet's East Asian proconsul. But as with the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe and Afghanistan, the people have rebelled against their overlords.  Rather than rescuing the oppressors in either case, the United States should help those resisting the new colonialists. Indochina and Afghanistan are both draining Soviet resources that might otherwise be directed at either new aggression elsewhere or even larger strategic expenditures.  Gareth Porter suggests that we should provide aid to Hanoi if it withdrew its occupation forces from Cambodia. That would simply reward aggression. It would be more appropriate for Hanoi to withdraw its occupation armies not only from Cambodia but also from South Vietnam and Laos. Only then could peace and the possibility of accommodation of all forces in Indochina begin.  JEFFREY B.

"   , Vietnam, Dec. 18   Four American veterans of the Indochina War, trembling with emotion, stepped off a plane at a bleak Hanoi airport late this afternoon to an enthusiastic welcome by Vietnamese officials.  One of the veterans, Tom Bird, a former infantryman with the 1st Cavalry Division, started walking down the steps of the plane before noticing a group of  Vietnamese soldiers waiting to greet him.  Mr. Bird swiftly returned to the plane, trembling.  ''My first instinct was to call the whole thing off,'' Mr. Bird said several minutes later, returning outside. ''It's just too strange. I feel a little out of control.''  Mr. Bird and three other veterans, led by Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America, were taken in limousines to the sprawling, Cuban-built Thang Loi (Victory) Hotel on the fringe of Hanoi. They are on a six-day visit to talk to officials here and in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, about the issues of the estimated 2,500 American servicemen still unaccounted for since the end of the Vietnam war in 1975, as well as the Agent Orange question and the impact of the defoliant on the local populace.  Seeking Information on Defoliant  Mr. Muller, a 36-year old former marine, said the United States Government was seeking scientific information about the defoliant, and his group wants to persuade the Vietnamese to allow American scientists into ''heavy defoliated areas'' to assess the impact.  Besides Mr. Muller and Mr. Bird, the other veterans who arrived today after picking up visas in Bangkok were Michael Harbert, a former Air Force sergeant who flew bombing missions over North and South Vietnam, and John Terzano, a former Navy seaman. At the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, an official wished the group ''Merry Christmas.''  Three hours later, at the Hanoi airport, Foreign Ministry officials who deal with defoliation as well as the question of G.I.'s missing in action welcomed the group. Tonight, a Government spokesman, who asked to remain unidentified, said: ''It was sensible to invite the veterans to come here. They were victims of the war like many of our people were victims.''  During the flight from Bangkok aboard a packed Soviet-built Ilyushin 138, the veterans were alternately exuberant and reflective.  ''It's strange,'' said Mr. Muller. ''I can't figure out if I know the passengers on the plane, if I have seen them before. If I know them or if they know me.''  'Nothing Has Changed'  Mr. Harbert, who is now a management consultant in New York, stared out the window and recalled the missions he flew over the same lush, green mountains, over the Ho Chi Minh trail and the Cambodian and Laotian border regions.  ''Nothing has changed, but everything has changed,'' he said. ''I close my eyes and I am right back calling in airstrikes over these places. It's so strange. I can still see the scars on the ground.''  ''I feel so good coming back,'' said Mr. Bird, ''but I can't look at these faces up the aisle. I feel frozen.'' From the plane, approaching Hanoi through low clouds, the land was flat green, still pocked with crater holes. At the ramshackle airport, Mr. Harbert said with a shrug: ''It's amazing to fly into Hanoi without people shooting away. People are so quiet, the airport so simple. Like landing in a farm field. In Kansas or somewhere.''  Mr. Muller, who was crippled in the war, was carried down the plane's steps and was promptly surrounded by Vietnamese officials and local photographers. In his car, the Vietnam veteran said quietly: ''I can't even sort out my emotions now. I can't believe it. I am in Hanoi.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 18 1981 ,0
"      After six hours of talks with Hanoi officials, four American veterans of the Vietnam War expressed hope today that the emotional issue of the 2,500 United States servicemen still missing in Southeast Asia could be resolved in the near future.  Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America, the leader of the visiting group, urged the Vietnamese to invite the United States to send personnel to assist in the search for the missing Americans. Such a step would ''substantially improve'' Vietnam's relations with the United States and ease the ''logistical burdens'' that the Vietnamese claim to have in hunting for the remains of the servicemen.  Most of the 2,500 servicemen missing in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are believed dead, although anguished American families believe that some of them remain alive as prisoners of war. Reagan Administration officials believe that the Vietnamese Government has been uncooperative in the search for the missing Americans, although the Hanoi Government insists that there are no American prisoners of war alive in Vietnam, and all remains have been handed over to the American side.  Vo Hoang, director of the Vietnamese office in charge of finding missing Americans, said that the ''logistical problems were enormous'' in terms of sending out helicopters and search parties to jungles to hunt for the remains. Mr. Hoang told Mr. Muller that there was ''considerable hostility'' in villages to search parties looking for Americans.  Interested In American Proposal  ''The village people ask why are we doing this for the Americans,'' Mr. Hoang said. ''Why do we dwell on the past? Why don't we build the future?''  Nonetheless, Mr. Muller, a 36-year-old former Marine, said that the Vietnamese ''viewed with interest'' his group's proposal to send Americans to Vietnam to join the search.  ''This type of move would remove a very clear obstacle to the development of relations between Hanoi and the United States,'' Mr.  Muller said. ''We told them that, and they knew it.''  The Vietnamese, in a meeting with the four Americans who are here unofficially, also promised to allow more Vietnam War veterans to visit the country.  ''I get the distinct sense that the Vietnamese want to have good relations with the United States Government,'' Mr. Muller said.  Other members of the group who are visiting Vietnam for six days are Michael Harbert, a former Air Force sergeant, Tom Bird, an infantryman during the war with the 1st Air Cavalry Division and John Terzano, a former Navy seaman. All are members of the Vietnam Veterans of America.  Several Blunt Exchanges  The group has held several blunt exchanges with Vietnamese officials and has had some internal bickering and conflicts. This morning, for example, the group reluctantly agreed to acquiesce to a Vietnamese request to lay a wreath at the tomb of Ho Chi Minh, but only after asking the Vietnamese to bar photographs.  The veterans themselves, traveling around the city in Russian-made limousines to meet Vietnamese officials, express a range of emotions as they gaze at Vietnamese families pedaling bicycles over the streets.  ''Its so quiet, and the primitive level of everything here is stunning,'' Mr. Muller said. ''When you see this place it's almost obscene to think what we dumped on these people. There's nothing here.''  Mr. Harbert said that the ''standard opening lines of rhetoric at each meeting about United States imperialism'' disturbed him.  ''I don't like it,'' he said. ''I'd like to reply. They've done some pretty nasty things too.'' Mr. Bird, who is currently director of the Veterans Ensemble Theater in New York, said ''a couple of years ago I would have been given a medal for shooting some of the people I'm meeting with.''  ''It blows my mind,'' he went on.  ''What a crazy world this is.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 21 1981 ,2
"   , Vietnam, Dec. 21   Darkness falls quickly in Hanoi now, and by 6 P.M. the steets are silent except for the sound of bicycles wheeling lazily beneath the banyan and pines.  ''Its very drab, very isolating,'' said a young Asian diplomat eating soup in a crowded downtown restaurant. ''Life doesn't change here much. You live in a kind of suspended animation waiting for something to happen, but nothing does. I keep thinking I lost two years of my life in this place.''  Hanoi is a threadbare but still graceful city filled with contrasts. The other night at the Cuban-built Tang Loi Hotel a small group of foreigners, including four visiting American veterans of the Vietnam War, were seated in the gloomy dining room celebrating a birthday with a bottle of French champagne. A large rat darted past the table. The waitress giggled.  The Americans voiced amazement at the simplicity of the city. ''You visit Ho Chi Minh's two-room wooden-frame house, and you see two phones, one to the army and one to the air force, and that's how he carried on the war against us,'' said Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America. ''It knocked me out. It was so incredibly basic.''  Vietnamese 'Incredibly Warm'  If the American veterans were nervous about their trip to a country and people they had fought against, the mood was quickly dispelled as soon as they climbed off the plane from Bangkok, Thailand, on Friday. In encounters with passers-by on the street and in dinners and meetings with Vietnamese officials to discuss two main issues - the fate of the 2,500 United States servicemen still listed as missing in action and the impact of the defoilant Agent Orange in Vietnam - the reaction from the Vietnamese has been what one of the veterans, Tom Bird, called ''incredibly warm and sensitive and friendly.''  Visiting a war museum in downtown Hanoi, where photographs and weapons depict the campaign against the Americans, one of the veterans, Michael Harbert, a former Air Force weapons controller who flew 47 missions over North Vietnam, stared at an outdoor exhibit of a Soviet MIG-21 perched atop parts of the wreckage of an American B-52. Mr. Harbert stepped away from his colleagues and suddenly began weeping.  ''I haven't cried in 14 years,'' said the 35-year-old New Yorker.  ''I don't know what happened. It's the face-to-face reality of seeing that MIG, with its 14 stars meaning it shot down 14 planes, and seeing that wreckage. They are proud of it, and I guess they have a right to be, but it just upset me.''  As Mr. Harbert wept, his startled Vietnamese hosts expressed worry and confusion about why the museum visit had stirred him.  Veterans Are Uninhibited  The veterans, without a trace of inhibition, move down such busy streets as Trang Tien behaving like the servicemen they once were, passing out candy and chewing gum to giggling children, nodding to pretty girls and striking up conversations with people in bookshops and gift stores.  Many of the Vietnamese have heard of the Americans' visit over the Voice of America, which seems to be the main source of outside information.  ''You were hurt in the war,'' said an elderly man in sandals, pointing to Mr. Muller's wheelchair as a crowd gathered around the veterans on a street in downtown Hanoi. Mr. Muller replied with a smile: ''I was in the Marines. Shot through the chest by an AK-47.''  The old man shrugged. ''Welcome to our city,'' he said. ''Come back again.''  More Outgoing Than Russians  Vietnamese Government officials accompanying the Americans grin and seem a little startled at the outgoing nature of the Americans, especially as compared with the hundreds of Soviet technicians and their wives who stroll downtown aloof and without a word or a nod to the Vietnamese.  ''The veterans are so cheerful and friendly,'' a Vietnamese official said. ''We know the American people are like that.'' At formal meetings with the veterans, officials inevitably point out that they have ''never have any animosity toward the American people.'' American Governments, on the other hand, have ''lied and sought the destruction of our country,'' the Vietnamese say.  Asian and Western diplomats in Hanoi agree that many Vietnamese miss the personal contact with Americans that they once had. A Western diplomat observed: ''The Vietnamese had 1,000 years of domination under the Chinese, 100 under the French and 8 under the Americans. You fellows are egalitarians. You treated Vietnamese with a level of equality that other foreigners never did. There is, in retrospect, a residue of good will toward the G.I.'s that's very, very strong.''

"   , Vietnam, Dec. 22   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told visiting Americans on Monday that Vietnam would welcome specialists who wanted to study the impact of the herbicide Agent Orange used during the war.  At the conclusion of a 90-minute meeting with four American veterans of the Vietnam War, Mr. Thach embraced each one of them and said: ''We are all victims; we are not enemies.''  In his remarks, he charged that the Reagan Administration remained hostile toward Vietnam and he denied that the Vietnamese were withholding information about the fate of 2,500 Americans missing in action.  He said Hanoi would henceforth deal on the issue with the Vietnam veterans' group and not with Washington.  ''The Vietnamese Government will cooperate with you on the missing in action on a humanitarian basis without any conditions,'' he said.  ''We will cooperate with you, not with Reagan and the Administration. They have repaid our humanitarian activity with hostility.''  One of the Americans, Robert O. Muller, who is executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America, said later that he ''welcomed this new initiative.'' He said his group would deal with Vietnam's mission to the United Nations.  Mr. Thach, who spoke in English, welcomed the visitors by saying: ''The way for friendship is very long. The way for war is very short. The American people must come to know the Vietnamese people.  We must cooperate with one another. Tell your people that, between Vietnam and the American people, there was no victory or defeat. We were all victims. It was a war of Johnson and Nixon against the American people.''  Mr. Muller, a former Marine officer crippled in the war, said the ''priority issues'' were the question of the missing in action as well as the problem of the herbicide, which was sprayed as a defoliant in South Vietnam and may cause cancer and birth defects.  Mr. Thach agreed to Mr. Muller's suggestion that American physicians and scientists come to Vietnam to assess the impact of the herbicide. Mr. Muller said his aim was to use the possible findings in connection with claims by veterans that they and their offspring had been affected.  Mr. Thach said, ''We will cooperate with you,'' but he added that the Vietnamese Government would grant visas only to investigators who were ''independent and not connected with Reagan.'' Mr. Muller assured him that there were people not connected with the Government who would come.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 23 1981 ,2
"    To the Editor:  For many Americans, Christmas week is a time of joy, remembrance and reconciliation. It is also a time inextricably linked to the history of a terrible conflict, now a decade old, which seared the land and people of Vietnam as well as the bodies and minds of combatants on both sides.  It is nine Christmases ago that American warplanes bombed Hanoi.  This Christmas, some American veterans of that conflict have returned to Hanoi to begin a dialogue about M.I.A.'s (those missing in action) and victims of Agent Orange in both countries.  Their return to Vietnam is painful and poignant for them, but it also holds hope and promise for all of us.  We wish to call on the American people - in our churches, synagogues and homes - to pause and pray that a time of healing may finally have come: that this journey back by some of those who fought will lead us to a much greater reconciliation of individuals and nations still suffering from the physical and psychological violence of that era.  For Christians, Christmas is a time of peace which began with the journey to Bethlehem. Perhaps the journey of these veterans to Hanoi can help us all find a new path toward peace.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Dec. 24   Four American veterans of the Vietnam War left here today after a six-day visit, convinced that they had achieved a breakthrough with the Hanoi Government and nervous about the reception that awaited them at home.  ''We've got to be very, very careful,'' said Michael Harbert, a New York management consultant who is associate director of the Vietnam Veterans of America. ''This is only the start. We can't go back to the United States and say that Vietnam is a great place because we accomplished a great deal. Vietnam is not a great place.''  Robert O. Muller, executive director of the organization, said: ''If I said what I truly feel it would be a problem at home. As veterans, each of us have undergone a profound experience.  Objectively, the trip was a success. But personally, emotionally, it's changed my view of the Vietnamese people and the reality is I've got to temper this when I get home.''  The veterans arrived in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, on Wednesday from Hanoi, after a meeting with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach.  Agent Orange an Issue  Mr. Thach told the veterans that he would welcome cultural exchanges with the United States and would open up Vietnam to doctors and scientists in order to assess the impact of the herbicide Agent Orange on the populace. Many veterans charge that Agent Orange has caused severe health problems for many Americans who fought in the war.  Perhaps most intriguing, Mr. Thach asked that the veterans group serve as liaison with the Hanoi Government over the question of the fate of 2,500 servicemen missing in action. The Foreign Minister voiced anger at the Reagan Administration for declaring that Hanoi was not doing enough to recover the remains of Americans or to divulge further information about those missing.  As the group departed for Bangkok, Thailand, after spending about 24 hours here mostly visiting hospitals and talking to doctors about medical needs, the former servicemen echoed the view of Mr. Muller about the personal impact of the trip.  ''The war finally stopped in my mind,'' said Tom A. Bird, a former infantryman who was briefly captured and tortured by the North Vietnamese. The other day I told some Vietnamese officials in Hanoi that I killed some of their people. I needed to tell them. They said they understood.''  'The War Is Over'  ''The war is over, really over for me,'' said Mr. Harbert. ''I went through some real anxiety when I came here. I was nervous as hell. I had fantasies that they were going to take me prisoner because I was in the Air Force and flew in bombing missions over the North. But now we're dealing with issues, we're dealing with reality and not the past.''  The four veterans, including John Terzano, who heads the group's Washington office, expressed surprise at the poverty that seemed to afflict Hanoi compared to Ho Chi Minh City. Beyond this, they expressed some annoyance at the ''posturing'' and ''propaganda'' in the opening statement by some Hanoi officials.  ''I could have done without all those words they used: 'aggression, evil, imperialist,' '' said Mr. Bird. ''I didn't take it personally. It just sort of surprised me.''

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Dec. 24   Christmastime in Ho Chi Minh City is especially sad.  The warm air is scented with jasmine and incense, the stores drape silver papier-mache stars in windows, but the downtown streets are curiously lifeless.  ''Merry Christmas, poppa!'' shout swarms of begging half-American children to foreigners. They clutch a visitor's arm. ''You take me home, poppa?''  If the outcast urchins are searing and visible remnants of the war - many of them are blue-eyed and fair-haired -there are other haunting encounters on the downtown streets. Near the market, a young Vietnamese woman is shocked to see an American she once knew. She is eking out a living teaching English and hopes next year to join her parents who fled to the United States during the fall of this city, then called Saigon.  'It's So Difficult Now'  She starts to laugh nervously. ''I've become so skinny, so ugly,'' she said. ''My face is old.'' Her eyes turn wet. ''It's so difficult now.''  She starts to speak but says conversation with an American is dangerous and starts to slip away. ''Life is hard,'' she whispers.  At the Majestic Hotel, a middle-aged employee looks up and watches a group of American Vietnam War veterans depart after their recent visit to discuss with Government authorities reports of American servicemen still missing after the war. ''Saigon is no more,'' he says. ''Saigon is dead.''  The city is certainly quieter and perhaps cleaner than it was a decade ago. Every symbol and sign of the American and South Vietnamese presence -building names, streets, billboards that once advertised Coca Cola - have been stripped away.  Tu Do, the raffish main street, has been renamed Dong Khoi (General Uprising), which commemorates the Communist takeover in 1975. The famed Caravelle Hotel is now the Son Doc Lap (Hotel Freedom) and is filled with Russians.  There are posters everywhere exhorting Vietnamese to work in the fields, pictures in shop windows of Ho Chi Minh smiling angelically, Vietnamese and Soviet flags linked.  Around the city, most well-known buildings are intact but seem a bit dilapidated.  The old United States aid headquarters, which spent billions assisting the South Vietnamese, has laundry drying on its windows.  Cercle Sportif, the last stronghold of French colonialism, is a workers club. The American Embassy is used by Vietnam's gas and oil authority. The landmark Continental Palace Hotel is shut down but may open soon as a barracks for foreign sailors.  Peddlers Hawk Their Goods  Changes are everywhere, yet the Christmas season has somehow stirred memories of the old Saigon. Outside the cathedral, peddlers hawk toys and cards and tinsel. There are holiday sweet cakes in Givral's and in La Pagode, the popular coffeeshop, which is still crammed with bored youths, wearing American sweatshirts and Adidas sneakers. They seem utterly untouched by the ''liberation.''  Yet the bulk of the city's residents seem bereft, hard pressed.  Officially there are 200,000 unemployed, but the figure is probably closer to four or five times that.  A special hospital has been set up for malnourished children. Wages are low - civil servants earn the equivalent of $30 to $40 a month, about the price of a pair of shoes.  Inflation Has Doubled  Inflation of many basic staples has doubled over the past years.  The shops are crammed with black market goods - Heineken beer, Salem cigarettes, champagne, tubes of shaving cream, medical supplies - mostly sent as gift parcels from abroad.  Especially poignant, somehow, are the ceramics - jade and porcelain that families sold to buy official exit visas.  It is unclear who buys these things: the Russians, the major foreign group, are known as ''Americans without money.'' Nonetheless the wheeling-dealing black market economy, now as before, lingers, with Communist officials turning a blind eye to it.  In his office in the old French-built city hall, Le Quang Chanh, deputy chairman of the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City and a founding member of the National Liberation Front, said that his aim was to make ''hard work and production'' the dominant values of the city instead of ''luxury and entertainment.''  'First Social Evil'  Mr. Chanh, a man in a green bush suit and wearing eyeglasses, said that the ''first social evil'' he had found in the city was prostitution. ''We built schools for these women. We cured them of their disease and tried to make them human beings again.''  ''We have resolved this problem,'' he said.  Unresolved, however, is the legacy of prostitution - the Vietnamese-American children who beg and prowl the city streets and are objects of scorn in socialist Vietnam. Their number is estimated at 8,000. Pathetically, some of them hold up photographs of their mothers and fathers, usually a G.I. with his arm draped around the young woman.  During the visit of the four American Vietnam War veterans, the children touched their arms, besieged them with photographs and letters, struggled to speak English and gazed at the four with awe.  The American group was led by Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America. His companions were Michael Harbert, a former Air Force sergeant; Tom Bird, a former infantryman, and John Terzano, who was a Navy seaman.  All are members of Vietnam Veterans of America.  As the Americans boarded their van to leave the city, they handed out candy and gum and some money to the children, who waved feverishly and blew kisses. Two fair-haired little girls began to weep. It was heartbreaking.

"    Four American Vietnam veterans walked through the looking glass last week and got a glimpse of what the war had been like on the other side. Whether their visit to Hanoi achieved much toward their main goal - clarifying the fate of 2,500 Americans still listed as missing in action - was questionable.  But they said it did help them come to terms with their lingering feelings of anger, guilt and fear.  ""The war finally stopped in my mind,"" said former infantryman Tom Bird.  The sight of a Soviet MIG-21 perched atop the wreckage of an American B-52 in Hanoi war museum brought it all back for former Air Force Sgt. Michael Harbert, much as the mothballed World War II bomber did for Dana Andrews in Frank Capra's film, ""The Best Years of Our Lives.""  Mr. Harbert burst into tears.  ""I haven't cried in 14 years,"" he said. ""It's the face-to-face reality of seeing that MIG, with its 14 stars meaning it shot down 14 planes . . . They are proud of it, but I guess they have a right to be, but it just upset me.""  The veterans also met with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach.  He asked them to serve as a liaison with Hanoi, with which Washington has no diplomatic relations, to help resolve the issue of the missing-inaction.  Some anguished American families believe that some of the missing are still being held as prisoners.  Hanoi denies this and also says that it has turned over all remains of American servicemen that it has found.  The Vietnamese Foreign Minister also said Vietnam would admit American doctors and scientists not connected with the Reagan Government to assess the effects of Agent Orange, a defoliant blamed by veterans for severe health problems.  The Americans, members of the Vietnam Veterans of America, said they were aware that their visit might be used for propaganda in Vietnam and attract bad publicity at home.  The Vietnamese remarked on the friendliness of the Americans, who strolled the streets passing out candy and chewing gum to children, for all the world like they were still G.I.'s.

"   , Vietnam, Dec. 22   Vietnam, facing economic crisis, food shortages and an uneasy relationship with the Soviet Union, is seeking to open contacts with the United States that would lead to diplomatic ties.  Comments by Western diplomats in Hanoi, as well as statements by Foreign Ministry officials, indicate that the Government's welcome to four visiting American veterans of the Indochina war represents an initial effort to stir public opinion in the United States.  Hanoi's aim, according to diplomats here, seems to be ''starting a process'' that would alter the Reagan Administration's stern resistance to normal relations with Vietnam because of the nation's occupation of Cambodia.  Visits by Scientists Planned  ''Tell your people we are friends, we are not enemies,'' Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, told the veterans in agreeing to accept American doctors and scientists to assess the impact of the herbicide Agent Orange and to work with the Vietnam Veterans of America on the question of Americans missing in action.  Life is bleak in Vietnam today, a situation brought about by political isolation, malnutrition in the countryside and urban centers, inflation believed to run as high as 200 percent a year, a series of devastating typhoons that damaged crops, a textbook Marxist five-year plan that began in 1976 and ended in failure, and the damage wrought by the war. The exodus of ethnic Chinese tradesmen and skilled workers has further aggravated the problems.  Beyond this, as a major legacy of the war there remain numerous reeducation camps, where former South Vietnamese officials, military men, intellectuals, lawyers, doctors and businessmen have been placed to be ''rehabilitated.'' Estimates of the number of people confined range anywhere from 20,000 to 200,000; even an approximate figure cannot be determined.  Travel Is Restricted  ''The human rights situation in Vietnam is very grave,'' said one Western diplomat in Hanoi. He said that the Vietnamese now needed travel permits to take a trip outside their own provinces, that job allocations have split up families, and that freedom of association was banned.  Even in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, which retains some of the frenetic tempo of the old ''pre-liberation'' days, authorities have closed down the city's renowned book market and confiscated ''unconstructive'' works, including children's fairy tales, romantic novels, mysteries and histories of the French and American involvement, the diplomat said.  At the moment, food is the major problem. Although Nguyen Lam, chairman of Vietnam's State Planning Commission, said the nation would meet its goals this year and produce a record 15 million tons, 600,000 tons more than last year, the effect of two typhoons in recent years coupled with the north's unsuccessful attempt to impose farm cooperatives and collectivization on the peasants in the south has left the population stricken and hungry.  ''My students sit and stare and clutch their stomachs with hunger,'' said Nina McCoy, an American who works for a Swedish aid group teaching English to Vietnamese medical students at a hospital in Vong Bi, l00 miles northeast of Hanoi, as well as in the capital.  ''People are lucky if they have rice and maybe a boiled vegetable twice a day. There's no fish, no high protein, and the malnutrition among children scares me.''  'I'm Seeing People Shrink'  Miss McCoy, who is from Cottage Grove, Ore., and is a 1967 University of Oregon graduate, has worked in Vietnam since July 1979, without any difficulty from the Hanoi authorities. ''I'm seeing people shrink before my eyes,'' she said. ''It's unbearable. Whatever food people have they try to give to their kids.''  Food rations in many parts of the country, especially the north, have been cut from an average of 31 pounds a month to 25.5 pounds, far below the 33 pounds considered the minimum subsistence level necessary before the onset of serious malnutrition. Fish, which used to be plentiful, is now in short supply, partly because fuel is scarce and many boats have sailed away with refugees.  On the free market, chicken costs about $2.04 a pound, other meat about $1.30 a pound, and rice about 45 cents a pound. The average income in Vietnam is put at only $160 a year, and one Asian diplomat in Hanoi said that the nation's economy reminded him of ''Bangladesh on a good day.''  Mistakes in Planning Admitted  Vietnamese officials publicly concede that ''mistakes in economic planning'' - or rigid adherance to collectivization and nationalization of farms - has jolted food production. One of the reasons for increased food output in recent months is a relaxation of controls that opens the way for some incentives and private enterprise.  It is this delicate balancing between ideology and reality that has made it clear to diplomats in Hanoi that the Government seeks relations with the United States. It seemed clear to the American veterans, who met Vietnamese officials - as well as foreign diplomats - that the Hanoi Government's view of the United States was skewed by the antiwar movement during the 1960's. The Vietnamese Government presumably feels that by meeting private groups of American citizens now, such as the veterans, it can build up pressures on the American Government.  The American group was led by Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America. His companions were Michael R.  Harbert, a former Air Force sergeant; Thomas A. Bird, a former infantryman, and John F. Terzano, who was a Navy seaman. All are members of the Vietnam Veterans of America.  Ties Seemed Near in '78  What Vietnamese Government officials seem not to realize, judging from a journalist's conversations with some of them, is that Hanoi hardly has the kind of popular support in the United States that the Government here assumes it has, and that normal relations with Vietnam are not a priority among Americans.  According to several accounts, normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam appeared near at hand in the fall of 1978 and discussions began on establishment of embassies. In Hanoi, the Vietnamese now show American visitors the elegant villa on Hai Ba Trung Street that was to have been the United States Embassy. But the Carter Administration drew back at the last moment because of the impending normalization of relations with China, which was antagonistic to Vietnam.  What followed, in November 1978, was a Vietnamese-Soviet treaty of cooperation that makes the Hanoi Government firmly reliant on Moscow.  Estimates of Soviet aid run from $3 million a day to $6 million a day for military and civilian projects, including most of the upkeep of the 200,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. There are thought to be 8,000 Russians in Vietnam now, and the Soviet Air Force and Navy have acquired repair and refuelling facilities in Da Nang and Cam Ranh Bay.  'Guest Workers' Sent Abroad  To repay the huge military and economic assistance, Vietnam has sent approximately 50,000 ''guest workers'' to factories in the Soviet-bloc countries, according to Western diplomats. In effect, the workers are paying off Vietnam's debt by receiving only a part of their East European salaries. The rest is set aside for debt servicing.  Vietnam's total external debt has climbed to $3 billion, according to official Vietnamese sources. Of this amount, about $1.6 billion is thought to be owed to Soviet-bloc countries.  Tensions between the Soviet Union and Vietnam have already arisen over Soviet influence in Cambodia, and some diplomats here predict that the intensely nationalistic Vietnamese leaders, who fought the French and the Americans, will never fall under the total sway of the Russians.  There are grumbles in Hanoi about the poor quality of some of the corn and rice that the Soviet Union has sent. Beyond this, there are personal complaints. ''The Russians make it obvious that they want no contact at all with the Vietnamese,'' said one foreign aid worker.  ''The Vietnamese say privately that the Russians are rude, overbearing people. The Vietnamese laugh at them. Everyone listens to the Voice of America, and everyone knows what's going on in Poland, and the Vietnamese are not fooled at all.''  Value of Aid Questioned  Moreover, Asian and Western diplomats in Hanoi say that the Russians are probably already realizing that aid to Vietnam is of questionable value. According to the Far Eastern Economic Review, published in Hong Kong, a team of Soviet shipping experts was shocked recently to find that goods sent from the Soviet Union in 1968 were rotting in the Haiphong Harbor docks. The Vietnamese refused a Soviet request that they clean up the goods.  Sweden, the major Western donor of aid, is finding ''severe difficulties,'' according to one Asian diplomat in Hanoi. Sweden has spent nearly $400 million on a paper mill outside Hanoi that was called ''a classic disaster'' by the diplomat. ''They are building a high-cost, high-technology paper mill,'' he said, ''and the problems of electricity and water and labor are incredible.''  The problems for this nation of 54 million, which has failed to grow enough or earn enough to feed itself, are compounded by the fact that about half the national wealth is used to support the armed forces. With more than 2.6 million under arms, Vietnam has the third largest military force in the world after the Soviet Union and China.

"    The Vietnam War is over, but hostilities continue. The intemperate words ''fraud'' and ''total disgrace'' are being unjustly flung at four Americans for becoming the first Vietnam veterans to journey to Hanoi. The accusers do not speak for the United States; they are an embittered remnant who should not be allowed to add sense and humanity to the war's casualty list.  The Reagan Administration endorsed this trip, for America has an interest in finally resolving the fate of 2,500 servicemen missing in action. That cannot be done without Vietnam's cooperation. Since Hanoi has resisted official inquiries, the Administration plainly sees nothing disgraceful in trying another route. The State Department counseled the four Americans, all members of the middleof-the-road Vietnam Veterans of America.  Vietnam may be telling the truth in insisting that it is withholding nothing on M.I.A.'s. But it will take persistent and urgent inquiries before survivors are persuaded. To cry fraud or to refuse any contact with Vietnam won't bring back the missing. Neither will it help determine how lasting is the damage caused in Vietnam by Agent Orange, another matter of passionate concern to the war's veterans.  Plainly, Hanoi had a wider purpose in inviting the American veterans. Economically hard pressed, and eager to lessen its dependence on the Soviet Union, it hopes for better diplomatic and trading relations with the United States. But the chief obstacle remains: the Vietnamese Army still occupies Cambodia.  What also remains is the Vietnamese delusion that Americans somehow oppose their own Government's policy and, out of guilt, want to make one-sided amends by normalizing relations. Who better to dispel that delusion than Americans who fought in Vietnam?  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Editorial                      ",December 29 1981 ,2
"   , Tex., April 23   For nearly two years, two tribes, one established and one new to this fishing village on the grayish, sunflecked waters of Galveston Bay, have been locked in a kind of territorial struggle as old as the species. Now the struggle is approaching a critical point.  One tribe is made up of American shrimp fishermen. The other consists of Vietnamese refugees who, having fled their country after the fall of Saigon in 1975, flocked to the Gulf Coast to make their living as shrimpers, too. Operating from a stretch of docks that has been dubbed ''Saigon Harbor,'' they now outnumber the Americans.  The problem, according to the white shrimpers, is that their livelihood is jeopardized because the shrimp fishing hereabouts will simply not support everybody. In the resulting dispute, two Vietnamese shrimp boats have been burned, and hostility and suspicion are rife in the twin fishing towns of Seabrook and Kemah.  Invitation to the Klan  Enter the Ku Klux Klan. Responding to an invitation from the American fishermen, the Klan has made several shows of force here in the last two months. Now local white fishermen and the Klan have been accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to threaten and intimidate the Vietnamese into leaving.  The case pits two longtime courtroom enemies against each other - the Klan and the Klanwatch organization, an arm of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Birmingham, Ala., that filed the class-action lawsuit on behalf of the Vietnamese fishermen.  The suit asks that Federal District Judge Gabrielle McDonald issue a preliminary injunction against the activities of the Klan and the American fishermen, which, according to the complaint, include the burning of crosses near some Vietnamese shrimpers' homes and boat docks and threats against a white who had docked Vietnamese boats. A hearing is expected early next month.  If the injunction is granted, it could be enforced, if necessary, by United States marshals on the shrimp boats moving out of the harbor as shrimping season opens in mid-May.  William Kerber, the Seabrook police chief, who has acted as a mediator, said the basic question - whether there are enough shrimp to support all the fishermen - had ''been lost in the sensationalism of the Klan rallies and the lawsuits.''  The American shrimpers, led by 36-year-old Eugene Fisher, a Vietnam veteran who was wounded six times in combat, assert that the influx of Vietnamese is going to destroy the fishery through overfishing. C.E. Bryan, the director of shellfish programs for the Texas Bureau of Coastal Fisheries, said there was no indication that this was so. But, Mr. Bryan acknowledged, ''Gulf-wide, the problem has been, and is, that the number of boats continues to increase, while the shrimp crop generally stays the same. More people are cutting the pie up into smaller pieces.''  That, says Mr. Fisher, is what he and his friends are angry about.  They say they are especially angry because of their belief that assistance from the Federal Government has enabled the Vietnamese to do better than Americans who fought in Vietnam.  'Feels He Can't Compete'  Some Vietnamese say that the Americans are upset because the Vietnamese outwork and outfish them, putting in longer hours, living more frugally, and pooling their resources to buy more boats. ''The American fisherman feels he can't compete,'' Chief Kerber said.  ''They live off rice and fish. The American fisherman can, too, but he's not going to.''  Some Americans who do business with the Vietnamese say they paid inflated prices for their shrimping boats. Again, Chief Kerber acknowledges this. ''The Americans saw someone to put it to, and they did,'' he said. ''What the Americans saw was a lazy, stupid individual with a lot of money.''  As the Vietnamese fishing fleet grew the situation worsened. Both sides organized. The leader of the Vietnamese group was, and is, Nguyen Van Nam, a 47-year-old former colonel in the South Vietnamese Army, who now runs a seafood business in Seabrook.  Mr. Fisher's group appealed to a number of Government agencies, pleading that since the Government resettled the Vietnamese in the United States it ought to help the fishermen solve their problem.  Mostly, the agencies said there was nothing that could be done because the Vietnamese were in the country legally and could work where they wanted.  Enforcing Unwritten Rules  The Americans said that the Vietnamese were not obeying the unwritten rules of the water. The Vietnamese acknowledged this.  Ground rules were drawn up and signed by Mr. Fisher and Mr. Nam, and Mr. Fisher says that they are generally being observed.  But the basic situation did not change. In the meantime, two Vietnamese were acquitted in the slaying of a white fisherman, Billy Joe Aplin, in a fishing dispute in the town of Seadrift, about 100 miles down the coast from Seabrook. Mr. Aplin was a friend of some of the Seabrook fishermen, and they regard the acquittal as a galling miscarriage of justice.  The Klan was invited, Mr. Fisher says, to attract attention to the fishermen's complaints. It did that. Two months ago the Klan sponsored a rally, with a cross-burning, to protest the Vietnamese presence. A boat was burned symbolically.  On March 15, a shrimp boat carrying robed, hooded and armed Klansmen startled Sunday afternoon diners as it moved past the windows of a waterfront restaurant, patrolling the harbor. It also approached the home of Mr. Nam, and the Klanwatch suit alleges that the Klansmen shouted threats at Mr. Nam's wife. The fishermen deny that anyone aboard the boat threatened anyone.  Cites Klan Threat  Further, the suit charges, an American fisherman has declared that armed Klan members will be on shrimp boats when the season opens on May 15, and the Klan has threatened to ''take matters into its own hands.''  The suit alleges that the American fishermen and the Klan, through ''unlawful coercion, intimidation and interference,'' are trying to ''monopolize the fishing trade for themselves'' by forcing the Vietnamese to give up fishing and leave.  Mr. Nam said last month that about 60 of the 100 Vietnamese fishermen here had told him they would sell their boats and leave.  ''If you no like me to stay,'' an angry Mr. Nam told a group of American shrimpers, ''yes sir, I leave.'' Should 60 Vietnamese leave, says Mr. Fisher, the problem would be solved. But he says he believes the Vietnamese actually have no intention of moving.  The filing of the Klanwatch lawsuit has reduced the potential for violence, Chief Kerber believes, by putting pressure on the American fishermen to moderate both their talk and their actions. In addition, there is at least one sign that local opinion is not solidly behind the white shrimpers. Two weeks ago, the Seabrook City Council, in a resolution, said that it would not tolerate ''merchants of hate'' bringing violence to the town.  Some Change in Stance  Since the suit was filed, some American fishermen have backed off from some of their earlier statements. Mr. Fisher, for example, once said that white shrimpers were being trained in paramilitary skills by the Klan. This week he said that was not true, that although the training had been planned, it had not taken place. Furthermore, he said, the Klan had not really intended to engage in any violence.  This week, David Collins, a spokesman for Mr. Fisher's group who is a defendant in the suit, stood at a dock in Seabrook and delivered a prepared rejoinder to Klanwatch. He charged that the Vietnamese had criminally tried to ''intimidate, harass and obstruct us from fishing in Galveston Bay.''  Furthermore, he said, ''we have reason to believe North Vietnamese Communists are infiltrating the ranks of the Vietnamese'' to cause disruption. Pressed for evidence and details, he said they would come out in court. He said that the fishermen welcomed the lawsuit because it would provide a chance to explore the basic problem.

"      Attorneys representing Vietnamese shrimp fishermen said today that a robed, pistol-carrying leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a self-described Nazi attempted to intimidate and harass their clients yesterday while depositions were being taken in suit against the Klan.  The lawyers asked Federal District Judge Gabrielle McDonald to issue a protective order and to assign Federal marshals to future proceedings. Late this afternoon the judge granted both requests.  Judge McDonald is hearing a suit in which four Vietnamese refugees who have settled in Texas are asking that American fishermen and the Klan be enjoined from using threats in what the Vietnamese assert is an attempt to drive them from the shrimping grounds in Galveston Bay. In the last few years about 100 Vietnamese shrimpers have come to the area and now outnumber the American fishermen in the competition for the bay's limited resources.  A hearing on the request by the Vietnamese fishermen for a temporary injunction against the American shrimpers has been tentatively scheduled for May 11, four days before the opening of the Galveston Bay shrimping season.  In court papers filed today, Morris Dees, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center in Birmingham, Ala., said that yesterday's incident began as attorneys for both sides were preparing to take depositions at the Houston law office of Sam Adamo, who is representing the Klan and the American fishermen. Mr. Dees said that a man entered the room and started taking photographs. He said the photographer moved ''within three feet in front of the faces of the Vietnamese plaintiffs and began taking their pictures.''  Acts at Bidding of Klan Chief  After about five minutes the man was ejected from the office, but he was called back and questioned under oath. He identified himself as Russell Gregory Thatcher and said that he was a member of the National Socialist Party of America, a neo-Nazi group. He indicated that the Vietnamese and their lawyers were ''his enemies,'' according to Mr. Dees' statement, and said that he had been asked to go to the office by Louis Beam, the Grand Dragon of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Texas.  According to Mr. Dees, Mr. Beam, who is a defendant in the lawsuit, later appeared in the room to have his deposition taken. He wore a white Klan robe, and ''upon observation of plaintiffs' counsel,'' the court papers said, ''it appeared that Mr. Beam had an ivory-handled revolver under his robe.'' The robe, the statement said, ''was thin and the weapon was clearly visible.''  Lawyers for both sides conferred with Judge McDonald this afternoon. After the private meeting, Mr. Adamo, the Klansman's attorney, said that he did not contest Mr. Dees' allegations. Mr.  Adamo said that he agreed to the request to hold future deposition hearings in the Federal Courthouse, with a Federal marshal watching.  While the lawyers and the judge were conferring, Mr. Beam, 34 years old, told reporters in the hallway outside the courtroom that he was not carrying a pistol yesterday but rather that it was a Bible under his robe. He said that he had held a cross up between himself and Mr. Dees, however, because, he considered the lawyer to be ''possessed by Satan.'' ''If those demons get loose,'' Mr. Beam said, ''we might need five or six U.S. Marshals.''  Robe Carried in Tote Bag  The slight, mustachioed Mr. Beam was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and tie today, but he said that his Klansman costume and Bible were in a tote bag he was carrying.  Eugene Fisher, a leader of the American shrimpers, has said that he invited the Klan into the territorial dispute over the fishing grounds to gain attention to his cause. Mr. Fisher acknowledged that he and Mr. Beam had taken the Fifth Amendment when lawyers attempted to question them yesterday.  Waiting inside Judge McDonald's courtroom were Nguyen Van Nam, a former colonel in the South Vietnamese army who is the leader of the Vietnamese fishermen, and the three other Vietnamese plaintiffs. Mr.  Nam said that regardless of the result of the lawsuit, most of the Vietnamese were preparing to leave the Galveston Bay fishing villages of Seabrook and Kemah, where the dispute has been centered, as soon as they could sell their boats and find employment elsewhere.  ''I know the bay is overcrowded and overfished,'' Mr. Nam said. ''I agree with that.'' But, he added, many Vietnamese would not be able to sell their boats by May 15, when the shrimping season begins. He said that those remaining would take to the bay alongside their adversaries to earn a livelihood.  Mr. Beam said today that the Klan would continue with plans to hold a rally in a rural area south of Houston May 9 in support of the white fishermen. At an otherwise peaceful rally in February, a boat was burned as a warning to the Vietnamese fishermen.

"      Witnesses on both sides of the dispute between local and Vietnamese shrimp fishermen on Galveston Bay testified in Federal court today that actions by the Texas Legislature in the last few days had lessened the potential for violence when the shrimping season opens on Friday.  For two years, the American shrimpers and the Vietnamese newcomers have been engaged in a rancorous territorial competition over the limited resources of the bay. More than 100 shrimp boats operated by Vietnamese refugees have begun fishing the bay. They now outnumber the boats operated by native fishermen.  In the Federal court case, the American fishermen are accused of conspiring with the Ku Klux Klan to frighten the Vietnamese into leaving the bay area. The Vietnamese have asked Federal Judge Gabrielle McDonald to issue a preliminary injunction against any further intimidation or harassment. She is expected to rule on Thursday afternoon.  In the first day of hearings on the injunction request, David Collins, a leader of the American shrimpers, was asked by his attorney whether ''there is any reason to believe that there will be violence on May 15 if this injunction isn't granted.''  ''No, I don't believe so,'' Mr. Collins said. ''I can't see it,'' he added, ''because the state has faced up'' to the problem of fishing in the bay. He was referring to a law, signed last week by Gov. William Clements, placing a two-year moratorium on the licensing of new shrimp boats in the bay. In addition, a bill requiring that shrimping operations be halted at 2 P.M. each day is expected to pass the Legislature soon.  These two measures, Mr. Collins testified, should prevent Galveston Bay from being overfished and maintain a large enough shrimp crop for all. Earlier in his testimony, Mr. Collins acknowledged that some weeks ago he said publicly that he would have an armed Klansman on his boat on May 15 if the problem of Vietnamese competition had not been solved.  Boat-Burning Threat Reported  James M. Craig, who operates a wharf and seafood house in Kemah, which together with Seabrook has been the center of the dispute, also testified that the new legislation would help. Forty-two of the Vietnamese shrimp boats dock at Mr. Craig's wharf, and he testified today that he had been threatened by a leader of the American shrimpers.  Asked on the witness stand if he thought the new laws would relieve the problem, Mr. Craig answered, ''Yes, sir, I believe it has to.'' But he said that he believed that ''there are still going to be problems'' when both the Vietnamese and the local fishermen take to the water on Friday.  Mr. Craig, who has been a consistent ally and defender of the Vietnamese who supply his business, said that Eugene Fisher, another leader of the white fishermen, had told him at one point in the dispute that ''I'd better watch my boats, they could be burned.''  ''I told him that if I caught him burning them, I'd shoot him,'' Mr. Craig said. Three boats operated by Vietnamese were burned earlier this year, and Paul Gray, a criminal investigator from the Houston Arson Bureau, testified today that all three had been set intentionally. This comment was elicited by Morris Dees, the chief attorney for the Vietnamese, as part of an attempt to show a pattern of harassment and intimidation by the local fishermen.  The court was told that a shrimp boat operated by Mr. Collins, carrying about 20 people, sailed around the Kemah-Seabrook harbor last March 15. Aboard it were robed and hooded Klansmen. Some of the riders were armed, at least one with a shotgun and one with an AR-15 automatic rifle.  Mr. Collins said that no threats had been made by any of the boat riders and that the incident had been designed as an attentiongetting device. The white fishermen feared that the Legislature would fail to act before the end of its session on June 1, he said. ''If you don't get their attention,'' he explained, ''they put you back in a corner and forget about you.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 12 1981 ,0
"      A Federal judge, acting on a complaint by Vietnamese shrimp fishermen that they had been harassed, threatened and intimidated over a period of months by an alliance of white shrimpers and Ku Klux Klan members, issued a preliminary injunction tonight against such treatment.  The ruling came six hours before the official opening of the commercial shrimping season on Galveston Bay. The Vietnamese feared they would be targets of violence when they and the white shrimpers sail out on the bay before dawn tomorrow.  In testimony this week before the Federal district judge, Gabrielle K. McDonald, and in conversations outside the courtroom, law-enforcement officials and parties on both sides of the sometimes bitter two-year dispute said they believed the tensions had lessened considerably since the Vietnamese filed the formal complaint and that all would go quietly tomorrow morning.  Judge McDonald seemed to acknowledge this by denying a request by the Vietnamese that United States Marshals be sent into Seabrook and Kemah, the twin fishing villages southeast of here, where the Vietnamese and American shrimpers have been engaged in a territorial dispute over the limited resources of the bay. The American shrimpers contend that the influx of Vietnamese fishermen has overcrowded the bay, threatening both their livelihoods and the shrimp crop.  Judge Warns Klan  But the judge said that any leaders of the Klan or the fishermen who violated her order would be held in contempt of court. And she assigned a Federal magistrate to hear and investigate any further complaints against the white fishermen or the Klan by the Vietnamese. Judge McDonald is to consider the granting of a permanent injunction later.  The Vietnamese, mostly refugees from the Communist takeover of South Vietnam, have settled along the bay in steadily increasing numbers and now outnumber the native shrimp fishermen. More than 75 boats are registered to Vietnamese shrimpers, many of them operating out of a Kemah cove nicknamed ''Saigon Harbor.''  ''The Vietnamese are here and they have a right to be here,'' Judge McDonald told Joseph Collins, one of the leaders of the white faction, after issuing her order. The judge said that she understood his frustrations, but advised him, ''Do not invite the forces of violence to help.''  Nguyen Van Nam, a former colonel in the South Vietnamese army who is the leader of the Vietnamese fishermen, agrees that the bay is too crowded. He said that he and others planned to sell their boats and move. But some who had previously felt that way, he said, might now wait and see if the situation stabilizes.  Legislature Acts on Issue  A moratorium on the granting of new shrimp boat licenses on the bay was recently passed by the Texas Legislature, and additional restrictions are being debated. Spokesmen for the white fishermen said in court this week that this legislation essentially solved the problem.  Nevertheless, Morris Dees, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center of Birmingham, Ala., and the chief attorney for the Vietnamese, argued in court today that the injunction was necessary because the real indication of the intentions of the white fishermen and the Klan was their behavior before the lawsuit was filed. Since the suit was filed a month ago, the defendants have been more restrained and conciliatory in their public talk and behavior, and attorneys on both sides of the issue believe this to be a factor in cooling off the situation.  ''They've changed their whole tune now,'' Mr. Dees said. He recounted several incidents, statements and actions that he said represented ''only the tip of the iceberg'' in a pattern of intimidation designed to drive the Vietnamese out of the bay area.  Witnesses at the injunction hearing, which was held over the last four days, testified that leaders of the white fishermen had vowed to drive the Vietnamese off the coast; that they threatened several wholesale shrimp buyers who dealt with the Vietnamese and who allowed Vietnamese boats to dock; that three boats operated by Vietnamese were deliberately set on fire, and that crosses were burned in the area on two occasions.  Sam Adamo, an attorney for the Klan and the white fishermen, said in final arguments that while the arrival of the Klan heightened tensions between the two sides, it was the kind of dramatization was often used to attract attention to a public problem. He contended that this was protected by the First Amendment's freedom of speech guarantees.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 15 1981 ,0
"   , N.Y.   An American flag waves above the front lawn in the breeze. Inside the modest house, the floors are crowded with filing cabinets and cartons bulging with photocopies of documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Departments of State and Defense.  One wall bears a huge map of Southeast Asia, with scattered sites circled in red ink. Aging photographs of a dark-eyed and short-haired young man in uniform stare solemnly from tabletops and mantels.  ''Nick was 38 on May 18,'' said Gladys Brooks, her tone conversational and matter-of-fact, but she and her husband, George, have not seen their son in more than 11 years. His bomber was shot down over Laos in January 1970, and aside from one early report - that Lieut. Nicholas Brooks had survived the crash, had been captured and escaped twice -he has not been heard from since.  But Mr. and Mrs. Brooks believe that he may be alive in one of those places ringed with red ink on the map, held with other American soldiers in Communist camps. For 11 years, the Brookses and hundreds of other members of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Action in Southeast Asia have waited and hoped. They have also worked to keep the issue of their lost loved ones from vanishing with other memories of the Vietnam War that many prefer to forget.  'The Deep-Freeze Treatment'  In the early years, the Brookses recall, they were honored at the White House, serenaded with stirring renditions of ''The Impossible Dream'' and lauded by the President and Secretary of State for their patriotism. But when the war ended for the United States in 1973, Mrs. Brooks said bitterly: ''All the doors were closed. It was the deep-freeze treatment. This is such a cover-up it makes Watergate look like child's play.''  ''The Government doesn't have the solution, so they don't want to make it known that there is a problem,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''It is too much trouble to try to get these men out, it's not politically feasible, so they just want to submerge the whole thing and wipe the slate clean.''  Two years ago, the Government changed Lieutenant Brooks's status from ''missing in action'' to ''presumed killed in action,'' although there was no new evidence concerning his fate. Until last week, the Brookses and many of the other families of the missing say, the Government had not cooperated with their attempts to discover what happened to the more than 2,500 American servicemen still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia.  But last week, a group of C.I.A.-trained Laotians were sent on a secret mission into Laos to investigate evidence from spy satellite photographs and other sources that Americans might be held in a Laotian prison camp. After photographs taken by the group were examined by Government photo interpreters, Henry Catto, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, announced that ''absolutely no credible evidence of the existence of any M.I.A.'s'' had been found.  Began Inquiry on Own  ''We know it's a lie, but there isn't a damned thing we can do about it,'' said Mr. Brooks, who is 62 and an engineer.  Three years ago, frustrated by the Government's inaction, the Brookses began their own investigation. They placed advertisements in Vietnamese and Laotian-language publications around the world requesting that refugees with any information about American prisoners contact them.  The letters have flooded in ever since, with more than 1,000 reports of various kinds, including 317 purported eyewitness sightings of American prisoners. Some of the reports are as recent as early this year, and the stories told by the refugees are chilling.  A Laotian wrote that three Americans had been held prisoner in a cave in Laos: ''They were arrested by the Communists and were kept there. One American was captured 12 or 13 years ago.'' Another Laotian told of 50 Americans ''guarded by the Lao Communist military'' and said that ''sixteen persons were serious sick and the others are sick.''  'We're Pragmatic People'  Such reports have spurred the Brookses to persevere. They spend all their free time - nights, weekends ''and I haven't had a vacation in 11 years,'' said Mr. Brooks - analyzing the flow of information, cataloging the reports and poring over the documents they have obtained from the Government.  ''Our interest is in the whole group of men, not just our son,'' said Mr. Brooks, a World War II Navy veteran who was missing in action after his ship was torpedoed in the Mediterranean. ''We're pragmatic people. We know people get killed in wars. But it's the not knowing that hurts. I'm not saying my son is alive. What I'm saying is that I don't know that he's dead. We have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that Americans are still being held over there. But it just seems like nobody gives a damn.''

"   , Vietnam, May 29   Vietnam announced today that it had found the remains of three United States airmen missing since the Vietnam War.  Vu Hoang, director of the Vietnamese office in charge of finding missing American servicemen, said the remains of the three airmen would be turned over to American officials as soon as forensic specialists had completed identification. ''The Vietnamese Government, prompted by good will and a humanitarian spirit, shall continue the search process,'' he said.  The announcement was made during a visit by a three-member delegation from the United States Joint Casualty Resolution Center, based in Hawaii.  ''We're pretty happy,'' said Lieut. Col. Joe Harvey, commander of the center, adding that arrangements for the transfer of the remains would be worked out with the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand.  2,500 Listed as Missing  Both sides refused to reveal the names of the three airman, among some 2,500 American servicemen still listed as missing in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  The Vietnamese announcement came less than a month after news reports disclosed that the United States had sent a secret reconnaissance team into Laos to seek evidence of American prisoners of war in jungle camps there. The team returned with no evidence that any Americans were still being held prisoner.  ''I have said many times and I reiterate, there are no American P.O.W.'s alive in Vietnam, and all remains discovered have been handed over to the American side,'' Mr. Hoang said. ''We have no interest to keep them.''  In October a visiting American group was told that the Vietnamese had scaled down their search for Americans missing in action. At that time Hanoi also turned down a United States request for regular meetings between the Casualty Resolution Center and its Vietnamese counterpart.  ----  Action Called Insulting  WASHINGTON, May 29 (UPI) - Ann Griffiths, executive director of National League of Families of Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, said today that if the Vietnamese intended to return the remains of only three Americans, ''it's a deliberate slap in the face.''  ''They are aware our Government possesses a substantial amount of information that has been substantiated by the Defense Intelligence Agency that Vietnam is withholding the remains of over 400 American servicemen,'' she said. ''This is another one of their dribbling out the remains of a couple of people because they must think it suits their purposes. It's really insulting.  ''It, of course, will ease the uncertainty for three of the families,'' she said. ''Of course, we are happy for the three families, if indeed the Vietnamese follow through and return them. As for the overall picture, it's disgusting. It's another indication of how they lie.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 29 1981 ,3
"    Amnesty International issued a report yesterday on a 1979 mission to Vietnam and a subsequent exchange of memorandums in which it urged Hanoi to close ''long-term re-education camps'' for thousands of prisoners still detained without formal charges or trials.  In one of the memorandums, dated September 1980, the Vietnamese said that about one million people had attended short-term reeducation courses ''and enjoyed freedom'' after the fall of the old South Vietnamese Government in April 1975. ''Only 40,000 persons'' were detained for long-term rehabilitation, and 20,000 of them have since been released, the Hanoi authorities reported.  Amnesty International called for an end to detention without trial and an independent commission to examine the reasons for it and to free those against whom no criminal charges could be made. The amnesty group sent a delegation to Vietnam in December 1979, and its members visited three camps and one prison.  A spokesman for Amnesty International, Larry Cox, said that while many prisoners had been in responsible positions under the old regime, ''many appear to be held because of current security considerations'' under the new. Mr. Cox said his group considered Hanoi's responses ''very good.''  The Vietnamese mission to the United Nations yesterday referred inquiries about the report to its counselor, Cu Dinh Ba, but said that he was ''not available'' and could not be reached.

The Hanoi radio said the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry had proposed that the talks resume in July or in August and be held in Hanoi or Peking.

"      The five non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia ended a conference tonight at which they laid the groundwork for their approach to next month's meeting at the United Nations on Vietnam's continuing occupation of Cambodia.  The Foreign Ministers of the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia declared that a political settlement must be based on three initial steps: the introduction of a United Nations peacekeeping force, the withdrawal of the Vietnamese Army and the disarming of the warring Cambodian factions once the Vietnamese have left.  A senior diplomat from one of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations said that the five countries' strategy was to convince Vietnam that it was in its interest to reach a political settlement that would make Cambodia neutral and thus satisfy Hanoi's security concerns.  ''This is not directed against the interests of Vietnam but the beginning of a common effort to enhance the longer-term interests of the region,'' said Carlos P. Romulo, Foreign Minister of the Philippines. ''Asean urges Vietnam to see the light of reason,'' he said, referring to the regional organization by its initials.  Soviet Bloc Opposes Parley  Vietnam, as well as the Soviet Union and its allies, have rejected the call for the conference, which was issued by Secretary General Kurt Waldheim acting under General Assembly resolutions calling for a Vietnamese pullout. Vietnam and the Soviet bloc maintain that the Cambodian situation is ''irreversible.''  Despite the Foreign Ministers' effort to appeal to Hanoi's sense of reason, sterner voices were also heard today and found a favorable echo among some of the Southeast Asian officials and diplomats of friendly powers here to consult with the Asians for the next two days.  A comment made in Peking on Tuesday by John H. Holdridge, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, was a subject of discussion. Speaking at the American Club in the Chinese capital, Mr. Holdridge declared: ''We will seek, if we can, to find ways to increase the political, economic and, yes, military pressures on Vietnam, working with others and in ways which will bring about, we hope, some change in Hanoi's attitude toward the situation.''  Officials traveling with Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.  explained in a briefing for correspondents that Mr. Holdridge made his comments in the belief that he was speaking off the record and was, in any event, not announcing any American military involvement.  The policy, they said, is to seek a political solution to the Cambodian problem and in the process to favor any action undertaken by others that would persuade Vietnam to withdraw its forces.  Haig Calls for 'Collective Strength'  Strong language was also heard from Mr. Haig, who visited the war graves at the Manila American Cemetery today and in brief remarks called for ''sacrifice with vigilance and unity to insure that we maintain collective strength to prevent the forces of evil who would resort again to conflict from having their way.''  Later Mr. Haig visited President Ferdinand E. Marcos at Malacanan Palace and delivered a letter from President Reagan congratulating Mr. Marcos on his re-election Tuesday to a six-year term. The Secretary also congratulated Mr. Marcos in a luncheon toast.  The American endorsement, as well as the announcement that Vice President Bush would represent Mr. Reagan at Mr. Marcos's inauguration June 30, disappointed Filipinos who had hoped that the United States would be more perfunctory in its acknowledgement of the election result.  ----  Vietnam Assails U.S.  BANGKOK, Thailand, June 18 (UPI) -Vietnam condemned the United States today for indicating that it would support military efforts to force Hanoi to withdraw its troops from Cambodia and charged that Washington was preparing to intervene in the region.  The statement, broadcast by Hanoi radio and monitored in Bangkok, was in response to the statement on Vietnam made by Assistant Secretary of State John H. Holdridge in Peking.  Hanoi radio said, ''Mr. Holdridge's statement means that the United States in collusion with China is preparing for intervention in Cambodia.''

"      Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. joined five of the non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia today in condemning Vietnam over its occupation of Cambodia and did so in terms far stronger than Vietnam's neighbors.  ''The United States will not normalize relations with a Vietnam that occupies Kampuchea and remains a source of trouble to the entire region,'' Mr. Haig said, addressing the Foreign Ministers of the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.  Kampuchea is the name that the Communist regimes in Cambodia have demanded foreigners use in reference to their country. This name has always been used in Cambodian.  ''We will continue,'' Mr. Haig said, ''to question seriously any economic assistance to Vietnam, whatever the source, so long as Vietnam continues to squander its scarce resources for aggressive purposes.''  Hanoi Said to Cause Instability  Amplifying on his statements at a news conference, the Secretary said in an icy tone and with vigorous gestures, ''The United States sees no great value - in fact we see just the opposite - in letting them have their cake and eat it, too.''  Mr. Haig accused the Hanoi Government of unwillingness to ''convert its military machine into more productive endeavors.'' This, he said, ''perverts the aspirations of its people and generates instability in this region.''  To counter what he called threats by the Soviet Union and its ''proxies,'' the Secretary reiterated the United States' determination to stand by its security commitments to Thailand and the Philippines.  Mr. Haig's address and subsequent comments were made on the last day of a conference of the five foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, their colleagues from the United States, Japan, Canada and Australia, and the Dutch Foreign Minister representing the European Common Market.  The Secretary of State left Manila tonight for Wellington, New Zealand, for talks with New Zealand and Australia in the Anzus Treaty framework.  Mr. Haig's sharp tone, if not his purpose, contrasted with the communique issued Thursday by the five Southeast Asian ministers. In an effort to persuade Hanoi to reverse its decision not to attend a conference on the Cambodian conflict to be held next month under United Nations auspices, the Southeast Asian leaders stressed the benefits in regional and international acceptability that might result from a more conciliatory Vietnamese attitude.  Strategy Disclosed by Japanese  In a surprise move, the Japanese Foreign Minister, Sunao Sonoda, disclosed what amounts to a negotiating strategy for the Southeast Asian alliance in a public speech in the meeting with his five colleagues. He put forward a detailed plan for step-by-step Vietnamese withdrawal, introduction of an international peacekeeping force, elections under United Nations auspices and repatriation of refugees.  The plan had been worked out over many months by the Southeast Asians, together with their friends, but had not been made public in the hope of persuading nonaligned nations to support it. Its disclosure at a meeting with Japan and the Western nations is believed by diplomats to diminish its chances. ''I feel upstaged and upset,'' a senior Asian diplomat said.  At a news conference of all the ministers, most of the questions were addressed to Mr. Haig. The Secretary was at pains to assure Asians that no arms sales to China were imminent despite his disclosure in Peking that the ban on such sales had been lifted.

"   , Tex., June 24   ''Funny how things change,'' Jim Craig was saying. Mr. Craig operates the docks of ''Saigon Harbor,'' the main base of operations for the Vietnamese shrimp fishermen whose competitive presence not long ago invited the wrath of native white fishermen and the Ku Klux Klan. Burning crosses, holding rallies and brandishing automatic weapons, the Klan and the white shrimpers threatened to drive the newcomers out by violence. Most of the Vietnamese said they were ready to go.  But Federal District Judge Gabrielle K. McDonald ordered the Klan and the native shrimpers to halt their activities five weeks ago, and since then there has been peace along the sun-kissed waters of Galveston Bay.  Cabin cruisers, big tugs, stylish sailboats and vessels tending the offshore oil rigs that loom hazily in the distance under huge piles of thunderheads - all glide easily in and out of the narrow harbor channel that separates the twin bayfront towns of Seabrook and Kemah. So do the squat, homely shrimp boats, their outriggers pointing to the sky and their green nets drooping, trailing clouds of seagulls as they head in to tie up among the sickly sweet smells of waterfront decay and the somewhat ramshackle seafood warehouses and restaurants huddled along the waterfront.  Everybody is too busy to fight now that shrimping season is on, and now that the Texas Legislature has passed laws designed to preserve everyone's opportunity to catch shrimp. The Vietnamese now intend to stay, Mr. Craig and others say.  Things have changed so dramatically that James Stanfield, a grand titan of the Klan who runs a marine repair business and was a target of Judge McDonald's order, accepted an invitation from some of the Vietnamese to repair their boats. ''There he was on the dock, working on the boat like nothing had ever happened,'' said Jim Craig.  ''Wild,'' said a visitor. ''This waterfront's like that,'' replied Mr. Craig.  Seabrook may be one of the most unusually constituted communities in the United States. The waterfront is just one aspect of its existence, and the conflict between the native Texans and the political refugees from Vietnam is just one reflection of the village's variable, even exotic, nature. This community of about 5,000 people, 25 miles southeast of downtown Houston, displays in miniature an especially tangy variant of the developing cosmopolitan flavor that has come to characterize much of present-day Texas.  It is a long leap from the kind of territorial dispute between the shrimp fishermen, a primordial type of conflict as old as the species, to man's attempt to explore the heavens. But Seabrook makes the leap and serves as a showcase for both.  Almost within jogging distance of the Seabrook waterfront is the Johnson Space Center, where the National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans and directs the nation's manned space operations. At least four astronauts live in Seabrook, and it is full of space center engineers. They have elected one of their own as Mayor and they control the city government. And the community they govern includes white-collar executives from nearby petrochemical plants, blue-collar workers at those same plants, and migrants from the Middle West, economic refugees who, like the Vietnamese, have begun a new life here.  So new is the mixture, in some respects, that paths of the varying groups often fail to cross. If Dick and Fran Jones are representative, the Middle Westerners so far have kept a low profile. The Joneses, who moved here from Michigan last year so that Mr. Jones could find work as a millwright, pretty much stay around the waterside apartment complex where they live, fishing and sailing on Clear Lake, which is not a lake at all but a shallow estuary that empties into the Seabrook-Kemah boat channel, or spending long hours at the swimming pool. The coconut-oiled Mrs. Jones has acquired a decidedly un-Michigan tan.  Although the Joneses are less than a five-minute drive from Saigon Harbor, they do not have much contact with the Vietnamese. But they tend to identify with them. ''We're both kind of like outsiders coming into somebody else's area,'' Mr. Jones said. ''I came here for the work. They came here to make a living, too.''  Mr. Jones, who had just put in a 16-hour day repairing refinery machinery, said the Vietnamese ''just naturally work hard,'' and added, ''They got a hard time over there, and they were giving them a hard time here, too. I kind of sympathize with them.''  One traffic light away, on the same side of NASA Road 1 as the Jones apartment and an easy bicycle ride from the house where Neil A. Armstrong lived when he became the first man to set foot on the moon, a sweating, grease-stained James Stanfield, grand titan of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Texas by night and operator of a boat-repair shop by day, paused to talk about the recent troubles.  He blamed the Alabama-based Klanwatch organization, which brought the successful Federal lawsuit against the Klan and the white fishermen, for the heightened tensions.  Mr. Stanfield said that, in his opinion, a major purpose of the suit was to put economic pressure on the white fishermen by forcing them to spend money, and time away from their business, to defend themselves in court.  The conflict between the whites and Vietnamese was never racial, he insisted, but economic. And now that the state has put a moratorium on the issuing of shrimping licenses and has restricted the amount of shrimp allowed per boat, he said, all is well. ''The fishermen tell me they can live with that,'' he said.  Like others, including Mr. Craig, who has been a de facto ally of the Vietnamese, Mr. Stanfield believes that the Vietnamese had no intention of leaving. Nguyen Van Nam, the leader of the Vietnamese faction, was out of town, and no other English-speaking Vietnamese could be found to comment. Most of them were out fishing.  Just around a bend in NASA Road 1 from Mr. Stanfield's shop, relaxing with some out-of-town engineers around an end-of-the-day keg of beer in an oak grove on a back lot of the space center, Jimmy White, a control-room engineer at the space center and Mayor of Seabrook, discussed his many-sided constituency.  Mr. White described it as predominantly ''middle-middle-class,'' with a mixture of backgrounds and attitudes. ''There is less of a class hang-up here,'' he said. ''We don't really have a class structure.''  Most Seabrookers do not work on the waterfront and were not threatened by the influx of Vietnamese fishermen. The result was that when the Klan agitation was at its height, it could not win widespread sympathy in the town.  In such a climate, the seven-member City Council, including four space center employees, had no trouble at the peak of the confrontation in unanimously declaring that it would not tolerate ''merchants of hate.'' It was aimed, Mr. White said, at Klan outsiders.  ''We felt like those guys didn't have a place down here,'' the Mayor said.

"      When Vietnam invaded Cambodia and threw out the brutal Pol Pot regime two and one-half years ago, the Carter Administration asked other countries to join in imposing wide-ranging sanctions against Vietnam because it violated international law. Now, rather than reducing sanctions, the Reagan Administration has accelerated that campaign, actively lobbying other countries and organizations to prevent any aid from reaching Hanoi, even milk that the children of Vietnam need desperately.  Unlike the United States embargo on shipment of grain to the Soviet Union, imposed after its invasion of Afghanistan, these sanctions have proved successful. Vietnam is in dire need of food. While America has lifted the grain embargo, it has placed new restrictions on aid for Vietnam. They are so thorough that in May a church was refused a license to ship a donation of wheat flour to the Vietnamese; last week, that decision was reversed, but only after lobbying by Roman Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant charities.  A recent United Nations Childrens' Fund emergency appeal for milk for Vietnam's children revealed how extreme the America sanctions campaign had become. The Administration responded that Vietnam should spend money used to occupy Cambodia to purchase milk.  Earlier, American allies such as Japan had agreed to suspend bilateral aid and grants, whether developmental or humanitarian, until Vietnamese troops withdrew from Cambodia; The World Bank dropped its program there, the International Monetary Fund may follow suit.  When Unicef asked for emergency donations of powdered milk, as well as butter, oil, and rolled oats, it turned to the European Economic Community. Two years ago, the E.E.C. had suspended its food shipments as part of the global sanctions campaign. This year, some E.E.C.  members suggested that an exception be made, but America helped persuade the E.E.C. otherwise. ''We had no choice on that one,'' an E.E.C. source explained.  Now, Vietnam's children, innocent of the politics of their elders, will suffer. Late last year, T. Berry Brazelton, a Harvard pediatrician, traveled to Indochina, where he discovered that the Cambodian children so recently subjected to famine were faring far better than Vietnamese children. He made the rounds of pediatric wards in both countries and found in Vietnam that ''the overwhelming reason for the childrens' illnesses was malnutrition.'' He said: ''The health system is good but they just don't have enough to eat.''  Dr. Duong Quynh Hoa of Ho Chi Minh City's Pediatric Hospital No. 2 found in an unofficial survey that more than one-third of the children in that city's nursery schools and day-care programs were malnourished. She needed the information because her hospital once received the E.E.C. milk and she was charged with finding a protein substitute. She is experimenting with beans.  According to a State Department internal memorandum, the Government recognizes ''the severe economic hardship of the Vietnamese people...including hardship brought on by natural disaster,'' but still contends that Vietnam can help itself by ''ending its diversion of resources from economic development to military conquest.''  The natural disasters are a series of floods, typhoons, and spells of drought that helped ruin past years' crops. The yield was low anyway, the result of general discontent over the forced formation of agricultural cooperatives. These problems have left Vietnam short at least 500,000 tons of grain, with no sign of increased outside assistance.  The Soviet Union, which gives some $2 million in military aid to Vietnam every day, recently cut back its food aid, citing the ill effects of the United States grain embargo.  More than blocking food deliveries, the United States' sanctions campaign has forced Vietnam to borrow heavily. Hanoi's debt-servicing bill alone is an estimated $240 million, while its foreign-exchange reserves reportedly stand at a low of $80 million. It is doubtful that Vietnam has the money to buy food.  And, while it has been suggested that powered-milk shipments for children would somehow reach the military, a recent report of a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization mission contends that aid to Vietnam is efficiently distributed to the needy for whom it is intended.  The sanctions campaign has been pursued beyond the bounds of decent behavior and contradicts the United States' traditional practice of aiding victims of disaster, especially children, regardless of national affiliation.  How can the members of the European Economic Community devoted to regulating the marketing of infant formula in hopes of reducing malnutrition worldwide simultaneously ignore the appeal for the malnourished children of Vietnam? Milk must be sent. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Elizabeth Becker, who reported from Indochina for The Washington Post, is writing a book about postwar Indochina.

"      Last week, a United States Air Force C-130 transport and a 10-member military honor guard flew to Hanoi to retrieve the remains of three Americans killed during the Vietnam war. The ceremony was more than usually noteworthy because such transfers are about the only official contacts that take place nowadays between Vietnam and the United States.  Vietnam ranks at the head of the Reagan Administration's list of ''pariah'' countries. Not only are there no diplomatic relations, but there are no ''interests sections,'' such as the United States maintains with Iraq. Washington, it seems, has set out with almost a vengeance to isolate Vietnam. Since President Reagan's inauguration, American diplomats have been instructed to persuade other countries to ignore Vietnam's appeals for help. Officials say that Sweden and Finland are the only non-Communist countries providing any assistance, outside of some limited United Nations aid, to Hanoi.  The rationale for this policy was stated by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. in Manila at last month's meeting of the five Southeast Asian non-Communist countries. ''Today, the greatest threats to the interests, prosperity and well-being of the peoples of Southeast Asia are the policies of Vietnam,'' he said. ''The United States will not normalize relations with a Vietnam that occupies Kampuchea,'' Mr. Haig said, referring to the 250,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. ''We will continue to question seriously any economic assistance - whatever the source - so long as Vietnam continues to squander its scarce resources for aggressive purposes.''  The limits of such a punitive policy are apparent and are not disputed by American officials. Vietnam's isolation has pushed it further into Moscow's embrace and complicated efforts to find a negotiated solution to the Cambodian crisis. A United Nations conference on Cambodia beginning in New York tomorrow is being boycotted by Vietnam, the Soviet Union and their friends; many other countries which oppose the Vietnamese-backed Government of Heng Semrin have shown little interest in attending. One Asian diplomat said it would be ''a conference that claps with one hand.''  While criticizing Hanoi's past actions, some of Washington's closest Pacific allies, such as New Zealand and Japan, have been urging the United States to try a more conciliatory approach.  Thailand, worried about its own frontiers and trying to stem the exodus of Cambodian refugees and Vietnamese boat people, has begun its own dialogue with Hanoi which so far has produced no results.  Over the long term, some Southeast Asian countries with big Chinese minorities, such as Indonesia, are more worried about China's intentions than Vietnam's, and are uneasy with Washington's tough stance.  The Reagan Administration answer is that conciliation was tried in the past and failed to moderate Hanoi's behavior. Now, Mr. Haig insists, the United States should stand firm not only with Hanoi but with Moscow and make it clear that, until they agree to a proper international forum for ending the Cambodian crisis, Vietnam cannot expect to be accepted by the rest of the world. Moscow Rejected Afghan Talks  The same goes for the Russians and Afghanistan, Mr. Haig has said.  It is now a cardinal element of Administration policy that if the Soviet Union genuinely wants to talk with the United States about strategic arms, it should first discuss Afghanistan. Instead, the Administration notes, the Russians, while continuing to issue arms control proposals for apparent propaganda purposes, last week rejected a European Common Market proposal for negotiations on an Afghanistan solution.  In tracing the history of Vietnamese-American relations, observers have speculated about what the results might have been had one or the other government taken a different decision at one of the many turns in the road. In 1973, for example, the Nixon Administration briefly hoped that the cease-fire it had negotiated with Hanoi might take hold and allow North and South Vietnam to coexist. Mr. Haig, who helped force the Saigon regime to accept that agreement, looks back on those days with bitterness, because of Hanoi's subsequent violation of the accord when it conquered the South in 1975.  The Carter State Department included senior officials such as Cyrus R. Vance, W. Anthony Lake and Richard Holbrooke who felt the Vietnam war had been a mistake and who wanted to end the enmity of the past.  Certainly, at no time since Hanoi's victory over Saigon was a United States Government more sympathetic toward Vietnam than in 1977. But the Vietnamese, for whatever reasons, at first seemed oblivious to the opportunity. They insisted on American aid as a precondition for formal relations, a demand that Congress immediately rejected.  The talks, conducted largely by Mr. Holbrooke, continued into 1978. The Vietnamese dropped their insistence on aid and discussions began on establishing embassies. But as these preliminary talks were about to conclude in the fall of 1978, Hanoi seemed to make normalization impossible again. It forced thousands of Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese to flee as ''boat people,'' it began to build up troops along the Cambodian border and it signed a friendship treaty with Moscow. Even the Carter Administration, predisposed to good relations, dropped the effort and concentrated on normalizing ties with Peking.  Now Vietnam is reportedly in worsening economic straits and, according to a recent Austrian news account, some Hanoi leaders are rethinking their alliance with the Russians, who are referred to derisively as ''Americans without money.'' But for the moment, Washington seems to have no interest in winning over the Vietnamese.  There has been no dialogue, aside from the talks on returning remains of bodies and on boat people, since the Carter Administration. And until Hanoi agrees to negotiate a withdrawal from Cambodia, the Reagan Administration evidently plans to keep it that way.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 12 1981 ,1

"      Today, more than 14 years after he was listed as missing in action over North Vietnam, Comdr. Ronald W. Dodge of the Navy was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.  His family wept as three volleys fired by an honor guard shattered the quiet above his final resting place. The mournful, distant sound of taps brought back memories of long-ago, happier times.  Commander Dodge's remains, with those of two other pilots missing in Vietnam, were turned over to American authorities two weeks ago by the Vietnamese Government. The burial provided an answer, at last, to the question that had been nagging Janis Dodge and her children since May 1967.  Their ordeal ended, in a sense, at 3:30 this afternoon, as a band played ''America the Beautiful,'' Mrs. Dodge stepped forward and laid a single yellow rose on the silver-gray military coffin wherein rested all that was left of Ronald Dodge.  Ordeal of Families Goes On  But for the families of the 2,456 servicemen still listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia - the so-called MIAs -the ordeal goes on. Many of the families are beginning to wonder whether there ever will be a final answer to the question that, for them, will not go away: ''Is he still alive?'' During Commander Dodge's funeral, the chaplain seemed to look to the heavens for an answer, calling on God to ''grant Thy great mercy on all MIAs.''  Officials of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia place primary blame for the long delay on Vietnamese authorities. They call the Vietnamese callous, cruel and unconcerned. But the league also asserts that American officials have not done enough.  ''The U.S. Government really hasn't scratched the surface on this thing,'' George L. Brooks, a league director from Newburgh, N.Y., said as he watched gravediggers lower Commander Dodge's coffin into a grassy hillside behind the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  ''They'e got about 30 people working on it when they should have 300,'' he added. ''But I'll admit that under Reagan they're doing more than they used to.''  Officer Reported Seen Alive  Mr. Brooks is the father of Lieut. Nicholas Brooks, a Navy pilot whose A-6 jet went down over Laos on Jan. 2, 1970. Mr. Brooks speaks of him in the present tense - ''he's 38, now'' - because the family has been told that some Laotians saw the lieutenant alive on the ground.  The official position of the State Department and the Department of Defense is that almost all of the missing men are ''presumed dead'' since combat ended for Americans almost a decade ago.  Government officials assert, further, that all that can be done is being done to persuade the Vietnamese to find and return bodies.  Privately, some Government officials have serious doubts that all of the men are dead. At least one behind-the-lines search mission reportedly has been mounted - it apparently turned up nothing - and the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe, recently told Congress he was ''personally'' convinced that some were still alive because of the stream of ''live sighting'' reports from refugees. As a result of those reports, the Defense Department's staff concerned with the missing has been doubled, to about three dozen people.  Military Authorities Working  ''We work at it constantly,'' said Lieut. Col. John Fer, of the Air Force, the Defense Department's principal adviser on missing-inaction affairs.  ''We send a constant stream of information and questions to the Vietnamese,'' he continued, ''but they mainly approach it on a 'Don't call us, we'll call you' basis.''  Thus far, after eight years of intermittent meetings and discussions, the remains of 78 servicemen have been returned. Besides the body of Commander Dodge, a native of Olympia, Wash., who would have been 45 years old last month, the latest turnover included the remains of Capt. Richard H. Van Dyke of the Air Force, a pilot from Salt Lake City, and the remains of Lieut. Stephen O. Musselman of the Air Force, a pilot from Texarkana, Tex.  Defense Department officials said the death certificates accompanying the bodies asserted that the men had died when their planes went down. No other information was provided, not even an explanation as to what happened to Commander Dodge, who was photographed alive after being downed. That picture appeared in many publications in the late 1960's, and both lifted and depressed the Dodge family.  The denial of information ''is the same sort of thing the Vietnamese did with the French after they pulled out of Vietnam,'' Gladys Brooks, Lieutenant Brooks's mother, said this afternoon. ''It just tears at you.''  However, officials of the League of Families report that most relatives of missing men are not suffering serious psychological or economic hardship. ''The military has death benefits and all that and a lot of the children were too young when their daddies went down to remember much,'' said Carol Bates, the league's director of public affairs.  What Was Dad Like?  ''But,'' she added, ''how do you reorder your life if you don't really know whether your husband is dead, or how do you grow up without wondering a lot what your dad was really like?

"    To the Editor:  Thomas Powers's review of Wilfred Burchett's ''At the Barricades'' omitted some of the more revealing parts of Mr. Burchett's career, parts of which ought to be known to anyone contemplating spending $15 on the book.  A K.G.B. defector, Yuri Krotkov, has testified that he knew Mr.  Burchett well in Moscow and tried to help him in his attempt to get on the K.G.B. payroll. Here is how Mr. Krotkov's testimony was summed up by the judge in an unsuccessful libel suit that Mr. Burchett brought against a member of Parliament in Australia in 1974.  ''There then was talk about the amount of money that a correspondent would need, and it was said to be about 10,000 rubles per month, and a free apartment and a car; and according to him (Krotkov) Burchett said that was what he wanted, to live and work as a foreign correspondent, that he wanted 10,000 rubles per month, a free apartment and a car. And these sort of things were discussed between him and Burchett in an indirect fashion; and he gave evidence of what Burchett had told him about the way he functioned in Korea, and the way he functioned in Hanoi, where he had worked for the Chinese and North Vietnamese Governments. ...  ''Burchett said to him, 'I am really a member of the Australian Communist Party, but all these years I was involved in sort of illegal activities. In other words, I didn't say openly whether I was a member of the Communist Party or not, but I was and I am. And as a member of the Communist Party I was in China; I was and I am in very close relation personally with Chou En-lai. ... And I served our case, the Communist case, the Communist Party of China, giving them very valuable information when I was in Korea among the foreign correspondents. ... The same thing happened in Hanoi. I went to Hanoi and I am now in Hanoi. I am established there on the payroll of the party. I am in close relation with Ho Chi Minh ... I am deeply involved in this trouble against the Americans ... And of course, I can be as useful in Moscow, again from an ideological point of view, for our common cause.' ''  Mr. Krotkov went on to say that Mr. Burchett maintained a close relationship with Colonel Borodin Barsegov, then head of the special K.G.B. department responsible for subverting foreign correspondents in Moscow. Mr. Krotkov identified Mr. Burchett's ''case officer'' as Victor Kartzev, a top-rank K.G.B. officer.  No discussion of Wilfred Burchett would be complete without mention of the prominent role he played in extracting and rewriting phony germ warfare confessions from American POWs in North Korea during the Korean War. Derek Kinne of Tucson, Ariz., was one of the POWs who says he suffered because of Mr. Burchett. Mr. Kinne says he argued with Mr. Burchett in the POW camp, and Mr. Burchett said, ''I could have you shot.'' Immediately after that Mr. Kinne was subjected to cruel torture because of the way he had talked to ''Comrade Burchett.'' He was kept in solitary confinement for 13 months. ...

"   , Pescadores   More than six years after the Communist victory, countless thousands of Vietnamese who served the former Saigon Government remain imprisoned in jungle camps, uncharged, untried and unsure whether they will ever be released.  Although the Government in Hanoi announced in response to international criticism that in no case would the imprisonment for ''re-education'' exceed three years, the outflow of refugees continues to bring to other shores men who have only recently been released from such concentration camps.  Pham Van Phu, who was arrested in June 1975 for having been a judge in Saigon Criminal Court, arrived at this island group in the Formosa Strait on a small fishing boat in mid-June. He said he was released last January from a ''re-education'' camp at Xuyen Moc in Dong Nai province, about 200 miles north of the former South Vietnamese capital.  About 4,000 prisoners remained, Mr. Phu said, of which all but 200 had been junior oficers, lieutenants and captains in the South Vietnamese Army. The others were low-level and medium-level civil servants like himself. The Xuyen Moc camp was particularly big, the 41-year-old former judge said, but every province in South Vietnam is known to have one or more camps.  Senior Officers Sent to the North  Like other former camp inmates, Mr. Phu emphasized that only lower-ranking officers and civil servants remained in southern camps, while those of senior level in the military and the old Government, as well as those accused of ''crimes against the people,'' were sent to the north. A feeling has long taken root among their families that those in northern camps will never be released.  Throughout his imprisonment, during which his weight dropped from 138 to 99 pounds, Mr. Phu said he had never been confronted with any accusation or interrogated. His release, like his arrest, was accompanied by no comment or justification.  The only aspect of camp life that might justify the term ''reeducation,'' Mr. Phu said, was the occasional reading by one of the prisoners to his work gang of an editorial from one of the party newspapers, which the group was then to discuss. But the former judge said that such discussion lasted only as long as a guard was watching.  Similarly, he added, the daily review of the group's work, to be followed by mutual and self-criticism, never went on beyond the presence of the guards, all of whom were North Vietnamese. Only in the first month of his imprisonment was Mr. Phu subjected to nine political lectures and ordered to write and rewrite at least 15 times a detailed account of his life.  Hard Labor With Minimal Food  For the rest of Mr. Phu's five and a half years of imprisonment, his and his fellow inmates' lot was hard labor with minimal food, bare shelter, ragged clothes and a total absence of any medical attention. The work consisted of clearing the jungle and planting the corn and root crops that were almost their only fare.  ''We couldn't live without the food that our families bring us,'' said the former judge, glancing at his wife, who, sitting at his side through his long narration, mirrored on her intense face the recollection of years of anguish. ''We had to submit a list of the food we brought, and if, for instance, we listed only 'beans' instead of 'red beans,' they would confiscate it,'' said his wife, Mrs. Pham Van Phu, whose eyes look older than her 35 years.  The family visits occurred every two months and were limited to 30 minutes. ''Almost every time I went I saw men carrying bodies and I was afraid,'' Mrs. Phu said, looking at her husband. ''Many died in the beginning,'' he said.  Mr. Phu recalled the death of a well-known writer, Nguyen Manh Con, who demanded to be freed after the three stated years of ''reeducation'' were up. He was told that he could be released into prison. He went on a hunger strike and died after about a month.  Problems Continue After Release  Hunger was a constant of camp life, Mr. Phu recalled, on a diet that was rarely supplemented by vegetables and only three times a year by fish or meat - the judge held up two fingers to indicate the size of the ration - on the Lunar New Year, Ho Chi Minh's birthday and independence day.  Consistent with accounts of others released from ''re-education,'' Mr. Phu said that his problems did not end with his release. To be allowed to return to live with his wife in their old home required a residence permit given only to those holding permanent jobs, and no permanent jobs were available for persons without a residence permit.  The objective of this Kafkaesque procedure, according to former detainees, was to put pressure on them to return with their families to such regions as those in which they were imprisoned, to try to eke out a livelihood from jungle areas prisoners were clearing. Instead, like many other former prisoners, Mr. Phu used his temporary legal stay in Ho Chi Minh City, Saigon's new name, to arrange for his escape.  Mr. Phu, who prefers to speak only of matters that he has seen, said he could not estimate the total of political prisoners still detained. But a friend who escaped with him, Bui Huu Do, a hydraulic engineer, said, ''Where there are prisons there are prisoners, and there are five or six camps in every province.''

"   , Thailand, Aug. 13   A representative of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia today turned over to American officials skull fragments that were said to be the remains of three American airmen missing in action over Laos since the Vietnam War. The remains are to be sent to forensic experts in Hawaii for identification.  Lao rebel forces reportedly found the remains in a village near a documented crash site in south central Laos.  The rebels gave the remains to George Brooks, a member of the board of directors of the league, an organization of wives and parents of the more than 2,500 Americans still missing in action in Indochina.  Mr. Brooks, an engineer from Newburgh, N.Y., whose son Nick disappeared over Laos in 1970, in turn gave the remains to American officials in Bangkok, who will send them to Hawaii.

"      The Defense Department said today that remains turned over to the United States authorities in Thailand in July and August were not those of eight American servicemen missing in Laos.  A Pentagon announcement said the remains were all ''Southeast Asian Mongoloid and not American.'' The remains had been turned over to the United States Embassy in Bangkok in two sets of four by ''Laotian sources'' and were said to be those of missing American soldiers, the announcement said.  ''Analysis by the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii proved this contention to be false,'' it said.  The announcement also said the United States Government was continuing to press the authorities in Indochina for the fullest accounting of missing Americans but had got ''extremely little cooperation.''  The remains of three American pilots turned over by the Vietnamese Government at about the same time had been positively identified.  They were buried after a ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery.  More than 2,400 Americans are still listed as missing in action in Indochina.  Found by Guerrillas  According to a report July 14 from Bangkok, an embassy spokesman, Lieut. Col. Paul Mather, said anti-Communist guerrillas who had made a recent foray into Laos had brought back two sets of remains said to be those of American fliers killed in the war.  The report quoted Colonel Mather as saying the remains had been turned over to him by an American citizen who lives in Bangkok, identified as Robert W. Schwab 3d. The report added that unidentified sources close to anti-Communist Laotian guerrillas said he recently accompanied a group into southern Laos to a crash site where the remains were found.  On Aug. 13, according to a report from Bangkok, the embassy received what were said to be the remains of four more American airmen shot down over Laos. The report added that George Brooks, a member of the board of the National League of Families, an organization set up in 1970 to find Americans missing in action, said he acted as an intermediary in handing over the remains.

"    To the Editor:  We are writing in regard to your recent series of news articles concerning four American veterans and their visit to Vietnam, and particularly in regard to the last article, on Dec. 27.  In this article, your correspondent covered the contact between the American veterans and children of American soldiers in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon). While we are very pleased that this story has been presented, we are equally displeased at the biased, stereotyped labeling of those children's mothers as prostitutes.  To anyone who spent a year in Vietnam during the war and came to know the Vietnamese people, it would be clear that the Vietnamese mothers of American servicemen's children are not prostitutes - rather they are decent, loving persons who care for their children.  Moreover, had they been prostitutes, there would have been abortions, not children.  By and large, the children's fathers served in combat-support and other noncombat units and formed more than transitory relationships with these women.  There would be no fatherless children had the hierarchy of the American military forces permitted, rather than systematically prevented, the legitimate marriages that both American servicemen and their Vietnamese women desired. To compound this situation, in order to prevent harassment by the South Vietnamese authorities, bribes were necessary to obtain passports for Vietnamese women.  We suppose that many, perhaps nearly all, the fathers of these children are living, and a substantial number of them would welcome renewed conta ct.  What The Times has done, however, is to perpetuate a backward racial stereotype, which undermines the dignity of Vietnamese women and does the fathers in the United States little good. Moreover, it harms the goal of r econciliation so long sought. WILLIAM J. SIMON, JOHN P.

"    To the Editor:  With regard to your Dec. 30 editorial ''Apocalypse Forever?'' pertaining to the four Vietnam-era veterans who recently visited Hanoi, I am amazed at The Times's naive view of both the veterans' and the Communists' motives for the trip.  The Reagan Administration certainly did not endorse this Penthouse magazine-sponsored trip. It was simply that t here was no way to stop it. Thus the veterans were briefed by both th e State and Defense Departments, to acquire a quick education on the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue and be cautioned against being used for propa ganda by the Vietnamese.Members of Congress familiar with this issue provided similar counsel, as did the National  League of P.O.W./M.I.A. Families.  While the league certainly welcomes help and support from concerned Americans, it is frankly appalling that Robert Muller and his associates have yet to contact our organization to brief us on the results of the trip, particularly since one of their alleged issues was accounting for the 2,500 missing Americans.  The Times is erroneous in attributing credibility to Hanoi's claims that it possesses no information on the missing. There is convincing evidence that live Americans are still being held in Vietnam, and there is valid intelligence data to prove that the Vietnamese are currently warehousing the remains of over 400 Ameri-cans. The group was briefed on this evidence by the Defense Intelligence Agency, rendering Mr. Muller's parroting of Communist denials even more astounding.  P.O.W./M.I.A. families have no desire to prolong the war; we simply want to know what happened to our men. Hanoi has answers and our Government will eventually have to deal directly with them to resolve the issue. Giving Mr. Muller the benefit of presuming his stated motives to be valid, the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue is a serious problem and there is little room for amateur diplomats.

"    PATCHOGUE ''IN Vietnam we would have celebrated the new year for three days, but working here makes that pretty difficult,'' said Dr. Luong Phan of Patchogue. But Dr. Phan, who works at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, did ask for a holiday last Monday, the first day of the Lunar New Year traditionally observed in Viet nam.  The Vietnamese New Year, called Tet, follows the same chronology as the Chinese New Year, with each year of the 12-year cycle identified by a different creature (this year it's the dog). Both cultures mark the holiday by setting off firecrackers, exchanging bits of money and dining on a number of traditional foods.  Although the foods share certain similarities, the special preparations for the New Year reflect the rather marked differences that exist in general between the cuisine of Vietnam and that of China.  ''Vietnamese food is lighter and fresher, with less oil and no heavy sauces or cornstarch,'' said Le Nguyen, who, with her husband, Tuan, owns the Hee Hing Restaurant in Patchogue, where several Vietnamese families shared New Year's dishes. Hee Hing is the only Vietnamese restaurant on the Island, and one of very few in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area.  In Vietnamese cuisine, raw vegetables are served extensively, whereas in Chinese they are relatively unimportant. There is an enormous variety of spring roll-type preparations, which call for meat, poultry, seafood or vegetables to be wrapped in dough or lettuce leaves and often are not fried. Thin but fiery and pungent dipping sauces season a great many dishes, as do lemon grass, shallots and mint. Instead of soy sauce, the staple flavoring is nuoc mam, a fish sauce fermented from anchovies and salt.  The New Year's dishes presented at Hee Hing were displayed on a table decorated with branches of blossoms hung with firecrackers and greeting cards. Fruits, some stuck with red squares for luck, and special sweets including watermelon seeds, tamarind, ginger and coconut were arranged on the table. The red flesh of the watermelon is said to bring good fortune for the New Year.  There were spring rolls, pork rolls wrapped in rice paper but not fried, stir-fried shrimp and jellyfish, slices of pork pates (one of which was seasoned with cinnamon), a savory soup of pork and duck eggs and several salads. A traditional New Year ''cake'' of glutinous rice and meat wrapped in banana leaves tied like a parcel and eaten with soup was contributed by Dr. Phan.  Most of the food was prepared in the kitchen of the restaurant by several of the guests along with Mrs. Nguyen, who regularly does the cooking at Hee Hing. ''We had a Chinese chef here in the beginning, but now it's just me with two Vietnamese in the kitchen,'' she said.  ''We serve mainly Vietnamese food. That's what our customers prefer.''  A page of Chinese-American dishes is relegated to the back of the menu for those who want it, but the restaurant's stock in trade is a specialty such as the ''Saigon pancake,'' a crepe filled with shrimp, chicken or pork.  ''It has taken us a while to understand what our customers are willing to try,'' Mrs. Nguyen said. ''They are not so adventurous.'' The Nguyens have owned a restaurant for about four years. They fled Vietnam, where Mrs. Nguyen had been studying law, when the Communists overran the South, making their way with two children first to Malaysia and then to California before coming to New York.  For those interested in discovering their cuisine, Hee Hing, at 68 Main Street i n Patchogue (telephone 654-8877), serves dinner every day except Mo nday from 4 P.M. to 11 P.M. On Friday and Saturday nights, the r estaurant remains open until midnight. A la carte entrees range from $5.50 to $9.50. pu lst & last add Vietnam (1st & last add Vietnam)  And to prepare Vietnamese food at home, the most up-to-date authoritative guide is ''The Classic Cuisine of Vietnam'' by Bach Ngo and Gloria Zimmerman (Barrons, 1979, $17.95). The recipes and ingredients are carefully explained, advice on menu planning is given, and anecdotal details provide background information. This recipe for spring rolls is from ''The Classic Cuisine of Vietnam.'' Spring Rolls (Cha Gio)  2 ounces cellophane noodles, soaked in warm water for 20 minutes, then drained and cut into one-inch lengths 1 pound ground pork 1 large onion, finely chopped 2 tablespoons tree ears, soaked in warm water for 30 minutes, then drained and finely chopped 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 3 shallots or the white part of 3 scallions, finely chopped A  7-ounce can crabmeat, cartilage removed and meat flaked with fingers 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 20 sheets dried rice papers (see note) 4 eggs, well beaten 2 cups peanut oil Carrot salad (recipe follows) Nuoc cham (recipe follows) Basic vegetable platter (recipe follows)  1. Combine soaked cellophane noodles, pork, onion, tree ears, garlic, shallots, crabmeat and pepper in a bowl and set aside.  2. Cut round rice-paper sheets into quarters. Place the cut rice paper on a flat surface. With a pastry brush, paint beaten egg over the entire surface of each of the pieces. Before filling, wait for the egg mixture to take effect, softening the wrappers. This takes about two minutes.  3. When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about one teaspoon of the filling near the curved side in the shape of a small rectangle. Fold the curved side of the wrapper over the filling, and then fold the two corners over to enclose the filling and roll it up to form a neat cylinder. Repeat until the wrappers and filling are used.  4. After filling the wrappers (this may be done several hours in advance and the filled but uncooked spring rolls kept refrigerated until ready to fry and serve), pour oil into a large frying pan, put the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate and fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until they are golden brown. Drain on absorbent paper. (If one pan will not hold all the rolls, divide the oil among more than one pan.)  5. To serve, mix one tablespoon of the carrot salad into the nuoc cham. Set the rest of the carrot salad and the vegetable platter on the table. Each person has a bowl in which he places some of the vegetables along with one or two spring rolls. The spring rolls are sprinkled with some nuoc cham and eaten with the vegetables.  Additional carrot salad may be added to taste. Sometimes the spring rolls are placed in lettuce leaves with the vegetables, carrot salad and nuoc cham and the lettuce is wrapped around all these ingredients to form a package, which is eaten with the fingers. For Western style hors d'oeuvres, the spring rolls may be served plain, sprinkled with nuoc cham.  Yield: 80 spring rolls.  Note: There is no substitute for genuine Vietnamese rice-paper wrappers in this recipe. They are sold in New York's Chinatown at the Tin Duc market, 91 East Broadway (telephone 212-962-5570), and they may be obtained by mail from Vietnam House, 191 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, Conn. 06105 (203-524-0010) or from Mekong Center, 3107 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Va. 22201 (703-527-2779).  Carrot Salad  1 carrot 1/2 cup water 1 teaspoon vine gar Pinch of salt 1 teaspoon su gar  1. Peel the carrot and cut into very thin julienne, either with a knife or in a food processor.  2. Combine remaining ingredients, add the carrot and marinate at least 15 minutes. Drain and use the carrot as a relish.  Yield: One-third cup.  Nuoc Cham 1 clove garlic 1 /2 fresh hot red chili pepper or two dried chili peppers 2 heaping teaspoons granulated sugar 1 /2 fresh lime 2 tablespoons fish sauce (nuoc mam) - see note 2 1/2 tablespoons water, or more, if necessary  1. Peel the garlic. Split the chili pepper down the middle and remove seeds and membrane. Dice and put into a mortar with the garlic and sugar. Pound to a paste.  2. S queeze the lime juice into the paste an d with a small knife dice in as much of the lime flesh as possible . Mash and add the fish sauce and water.  Note: Bottled nuoc mam, or fish sauce, may be obtained from the same sources as the rice-paper wrappers (see spring roll recipe), but it is sometimes sold in Oriental groceries on the Island. Be sure to buy either Vietnamese or Thai fish sauce, not the Chinese or Philippine variety.  Basic Vegetable Platter  2 cups Boston or leaf lettuce, not iceberg 1 cup fresh mint leaves 1 cup fresh coriander (cilantro) 1 cup thin cucumber slices, halved  1. Arrange a mound of the lettuce on a platter.  2. Surround the lettuce with alternating mounds of mint and coriander leaves and make a border of cucumber slices around the edge.

"      Southeast Asian officials and defense analysts, in a private conference with political and military officials and civilian specialists from the United States and other countries, have identified Soviet influence in Vietnam as a principal threat to the non-Communist nations of the region.  However, the delegates from member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines - were divided as to whether Moscow or Peking represented the more immediate menace in the area. They agreed on the importance of an American military presence in the region, and generally favored a strengthened, if still limited, defense capacity for Japan.  The Southeast Asians asserted that the booming economies of the five-nation grouping and the occupation of Cambodia and Laos by pro-Soviet Vietnamese forces had hampered the activities of Chinesesupported domestic Communist parties. They maintained, however, that a heavily armed and aggressive Vietnam posed a new danger for the future.  For example, a Thai security official said that the Vietnamese hold on Cambodia ''threatens the northeastern provinces of Thailand.''  Strong U.S. Economy Held Vital  Several speakers linked their fears to the negative effects on Southeast Asian well-being of economic disarray in the United States. ''We can do nothing without a strong U.S. economy,'' a Thai declared.  Other countries represented at the unofficial meeting, held behind closed doors at a secluded resort hotel on the island of Hawaii, were Japan, South Korea, Australia and France, besides the United States.  The three-day conference, which ended Feb. 8, was organized by the Pacific Forum, a Honolulu-based Asian and Pacific affairs study group headed by a retired American rear admiral, Lloyd R. Vasey.  American participants in the discussions included Richard G.  Stilwell, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense; Thomas P. Shoesmith, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Asian and Pacific Affairs; Philip C. Habib, former Under Secretary of State, and Richard L.  Sneider, former Ambassador to South Korea. The Asian delegates included the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, Thanat Khoman, among other officials and defense specialists.  Southeast Asian speakers expressed concern over possible United States military and technological aid to the Peking regime, which was described by a Malaysian as ''the greatest threat'' to his country.  An Indonesian said that his Government ''wants the United States to normalize relations with Vietnam,'' to dilute that nation's reliance on the Soviet Union.  Habib Rejects Any Hanoi Ties  Mr. Habib, who represented the United States in fruitless negotiations with North Vietnamese officials during the later stages of the Vietnam War, sharply rebuffed the suggestion that Washington should warm up to Hanoi, and even furnish economic aid to that regime.  American aid to Hanoi is ''in the world of dreams,'' the veteran diplomat declared, adding that ''there is no logical reason for United States policy to change in the near future'' in regard to Vietnam.  An Indonesian, who said that his country was ''very concerned'' about Soviet expansionism but did not see the Russian presence in Vietnam as an ''immediate threat,'' called upon the United States to cooperate in a program to enable the Southeast Asian allies to standardize their armaments.  Mr. Shoesmith declared that the focus of relations between the United States and friendly Asian countries ''should be on what we can do together,'' rather than on how one party can help another.  Mr. Thanat, the Thai Deputy Prime Minister, declared that ''it is time for Japan to do more than rely on the U.S. umbrella'' for security. If Japan ''only defended the immediate area,'' he declared, Soviet forces deployed in Asia would be ''tied down instead of prowling the Pacific and Indian Oceans.''

Although what would have happened ''if'' can never be proved one way or another, the facts argue against such conjecture.  Beginning in September 1966, Peking deployed up to 50,000 troops to North Vietnam. Between then and their withdrawal, in mid-1968, after the United States bombing was drastically reduced, two and later three antiaircraft divisions rotated deployment every six months to protect main communications lines, bridges and other targets.  Peking wanted its military presence to be known both to the Vietnamese and the Americans as a token of commitment to Hanoi's defense should Washington invade the North. For nearly three years, American pilots and Chinese forces fought a secret war, with casualties on both sides. Last year, Peking revealed that ''thousands'' of People's Liberation Army (P.L.A.) troops were killed with ''more than 1,000 still buried in Vietnam.''  It is inconceivable that, having signaled its commitment, the P.L.A. would then have turned tail and run back across the border if faced with an American invasion of Haiphong and Hanoi. Abandoning North Vietnam to ''United States imperialism'' would have destroyed Peking's claim to great-power status, both as a socialist ally and as successor to the Middle Kingdom.  ALLEN S.

"    The agonizing doubts of a Newburgh, N.Y., couple ended yesterday with the positive identification of the remains of their son, a Navy flier shot down over Laos 12 years ago. But the parents plan to go on with their work on behalf of others lost in action during the Vietnam War.  Identification of the remains of the flier - Lieut. Comdr. Nicholas Brooks, a bombardier-navigator whose carrier-based plane was downed on Jan. 2, 1970 - brought to 80 the number of remains of servicemen killed in action that have been returned to the United States since the end of the war in 1975. His remains were among those recovered from Laos earlier this year.  His parents, George and Gladys Brooks, have been among the most active members of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Action in Southeast Asia. Mr. Brooks, a 62-year-old engineer, is a director of the organization and Mrs.  Brooks is its New York State coordinator.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",March 19 1982 ,3
"   , Thailand, March 28   The Vietnamese Communist Party gathered in Hanoi this weekend for its annual congress and heard the party secretary, Le Duan, ascribe Vietnam's economic problems in part to the ''shortcomings and mistakes of the party and state agencies, from national down to grass-roots level.''  ''Our country is now being confronted with many acute problems,'' Mr. Le Duan told 1,033 delegates on the opening day of the conference Saturday, according to the Vietnam News Agency, which transmitted the speeches of the senior party officials and foreign guests.  ''The national product is not in a position to meet the needs of social consumption,'' he said.  ''There are shortages of food, clothing, material and other essential consumer goods.''

"   , Thailand, Sept. 30   Eleven children of mixed Vietnamese and American parentage arrived here today on their way to the United States.  The children, aged 7 to 15, are headed for reunions with their fathers, whom they have not seen in years. It is the largest group of so-called Amerasian children to leave since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.  United States officials and representatives of humanitarian organizations here are cautiously hopeful this group is evidence that, after years of pressure, the Vietnamese Government will allow more American-Vietnamese children to move to America.  Indeed, Vietnamese officials in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, made the surprise announcement today that 26 more Amerasians, with proper documentation, were scheduled to be sent out on Oct. 7, followed by another sizable group on Nov. 15.  U.S. Must Check Documentation  The documentation for the other groups must be checked by the American side, government and private officials caution. ''But if those dates hold, we are seeing more than a symbolic gesture,'' said John A. Shade Jr., director of the Pearl S. Buck Foundation.  The American Embassy in Bangkok has files on 3,740 Amerasians who want to leave Vietnam and it estimates that the total number who want to get out is between 8,000 and 10,000. Private agencies estimate the total number of Amerasians in Vietnam at 25,000 or more.  The Vietnamese Government has repeatedly stated that it has no policy of discrimination against children of American-Vietnamese parentage. American Government officials generally say they believe the Vietnamese claims.  The children suffer from discrimination nonetheless, according to American and European officials. They sometimes end up as street peddlers, selling peanuts, candy or movie tickets.  Life Can Be 'Pretty Grim'  ''These are kids who look different,'' said Donald I. Colin, director of the United States Orderly Departure Program, which is part of the American Embassy in Bangkok.  ''That hurts them and their mothers too, as the former consorts of the enemy. Their life can be pretty grim.''  For the seven girls and four boys who flew to Bangkok, it was a day of subdued joy, the anticipation of adventure and a few tears at the thought of friends and relatives left behind. A couple of the children had blondish hair, but most were dark, though their eyes tended to be more rounded than those of Asians.  They spoke Vietnamese and just a few words of English, if any. On the subject of their futures, the most frequent reply, in Vietnamese, was, ''I have American blood and I am going where I belong.''  Reunion Is a Big Hug  Gary Tanous of Vancouver, Wash., was the only father who made the trip; the other reunions will take place in the United States. Mr.  Tanous had not seen his daughter, Jean Marie, in 14 years. The touching if anxious reunion in Ho Chi Minh City was a big hug.  ''At first she was very nervous, as I was,'' Mr. Tanous said in Bangkok tonight. ''But she loosened up a lot and so have I. It will be fine.''  The children will be going to homes in the District of Columbia, Georgia, Texas, Arizona, Oregon, California and Washington. All but one of the children will live with their fathers. In one case, the father has died and the child will live with the father's family.  Among Amerasians, the children in the group were the fortunate ones. Most were accompanied by relatives, and they were all moving into established family environments in households that want them.  ''These kids are golden,'' said Robert W. Eaton, an official of the American Friends Service Committee.  It is the other children, whose fathers have not stepped forward to claim their paternity, that are the much more difficult problem, given the documentation requirements of American law.  Because of these requirements, an opening up by the Vietnamese Government may not bring many more Amerasians out. The United States may not be able to accept them. ''The pressures could well now be on America on the Amerasian issue,'' Mr. Shade noted.  To be documented as an American citizen, a child born overseas out of wedlock must be legitimized by the father. In 22 states, the father can do this by declaring his paternity and sponsoring the child in America, without marrying the mother.

"      Vietnam has agreed for the first time to allow United States technicians to visit and give training in the identification of human remains in the search for Americans missing since the Vietnam War, the State Department said today.  ''We appreciate this response to our longstanding proposals for such visits,'' said Alan Romberg, a State Department spokesman.  ''The Vietnamese have agreed to four visits annually, the first of which could take place before the end of this year,'' he said.

"    Forgetting Vietnam was harder last week. Seven girls and four boys, the children of American fathers once stationed in Vietnam, were finally coming ''home'' to the United States.  The children represented the largest group of Amerasians to leave Vietnam under the Orderly Departure Program, operated by the United States Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand. A more remarkable development - considering both governments' historic lack of interest in Amerasians - was the announcement last week by the Vietnamese Government that they were prepared to permit 26 more children to leave the country.  In Vietnam, Amerasians are often the victims of discrimination. And while cooperation with the Vietnamese Government has been difficult, the United States will not admit these children until a father claims paternity. The American Embassy in Bangkok has a list of 77 other children who are eligible to leave. Private aid agencies, who played a cental role in getting the children out of Vietnam, believe there are as many as 25,000 Amerasians in the country.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Oct. 7   Twenty-four children of American fathers and Vietnamese mothers flew out of this city's Tan Son Nhut Airport today after American officials agreed to a lastminute Vietnamese demand that two of the children be accompanied by their Vietnamese half-brothers and sisters. The departure was the second of its kind in little over a week.  Both Vietnamese and American officials said that if both sides stayed as flexible as they were today the ''repatriation'' of thousands of half-Americans conceived during the Vietnam war might proceed fairly smoothly.  The children, as young as eight years old and including a few in their mid-teens, seemed alternately nervous, excited and extravagantly happy as they gathered in the airport waiting room and signed their names or marks to papers presented them by American consular officers. Later, as they headed for the jet that took them to Bangkok with 23 of their relatives and dozens of other refugees, some of the young Amerasians, leaving relatives and even guardians behind, burst into tears.  These were much poorer children than the 11 Amerasians who left Vietnam last week, according to a United Nations official here.  Several of the children had lived in ''new economic zones,'' the notoriously mismanaged agricultural colonies that the Vietnamese set up after the fall of Saigon in 1975. They left today with nothing but a few small plastic bags containing their clothes.  Officials Ease Departure  Some small but important decisions by the Vietnamese and American Government made it easier for today's Amerasians to leave. Three weeks ago, when the United States submitted the list of those leaving today, Vietnam granted the children exit permits within hours, an unprecedented turnaround.  This afternoon Vietnam informed a group of American journalists that two Amerasians were being denied exit permits because the United States wanted more time to process the unexpected immigration requests of their three Vietnamese half-siblings. Then, after an exchange of telex messages between the American Embassy in Bangkok and its visiting consular officers, the young Vietnamese were granted their request. The plane left an hour later.  Today's children were already certified United States citizens, and they will be collecting American passports, as the children of American fathers, within a few days.  The State Department has identified 91 such American citizens over the last few months. About 500 other Vietnamese-Americans have been categorized as ''documented Americans,'' and embassy officials in Bangkok estimate there may be 8,000 Vietnamese-American offspring still living in Vietnam.  Tearful Family Reunion  One of the fathers wept today when he saw his nine-year-old daughter and her mother, whom he had asked to marry.  ''I'm the happiest man in the world'' said the flushed 37-year-old father, Ernest E. Crosby of San Francisco, after a long tearful embrace with his daughter, Hoa Phuong Crosby, his 33-year-old fiance, Nguyen Thi The, and his new Vietnamese step-daughter, 12-year-old Mguyen Thi Phi Yen.  Mr. Crosby left Vietnam as a civilian aircraft electrician in September 1974 and did not return until today. He had lived with his present fiance for three years before he left, and had known his daughter for a year. After 1975, mother and daughters lived either in Ho Chi Minh City or with her parents near the Cambodian border. They tried once to escape by boat.  About half the children are scheduled to return to their American fathers at the Phanat Nikom refugee camp south of Bangkok. Only three Amerasians were unaccompanied today. Only one, an 11-year-old girl named Lynn Fields, whose only language is Vietnamese, appeared to have no family at the other end. She was being cared for on the way out by Douglas R. Beane, a Vietnamese-speaking consultant to Church World Service.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",October 7 1982 ,0

"    A Transfer Point For Young Amerasians  Yesterday was a scramble for several refugee agencies. Eleven Vietnamese families - 42 persons -were to arrive at Kennedy International Airport from Bangkok, Thailand, early this morning, and there were still details in need of arrangement. Not the least of them was what to do with Amerasian youngsters finally allowed to come to this country.  It was the first passage through New York since the Vietnamese Government began allowing these children to rejoin their American fathers. Some were arriving under auspices of the International Rescue Committee, others through the United States Catholic Conference.  Most of the technical planning, however, was handled by a multinational agency, the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration, which was reluctant to give out details about the operation. Ultimate destinations of the children were not disclosed, and Richard Scott, the committee's New York representative, said he was not even sure how many youngsters there were.  That was because, in the way of officialdom, an ''adult'' was considered to be anyone over age 12. Quite a few of the arrivals might be, under any normal definition, children.  In any event, there was to be no long stay in the city for them.  Those who did not continue on to their new homes last night were to do so today.

"      Lan Grady has not seen her 11-year-old son, Le Minh Tuan, since she left Vietnam eight years ago, but she has had a letter from him.  ''He say: 'I hear from my grandfather and grandmother that you are my mother and you live in United States. I want to go live with you,' '' Mrs. Grady, a Vietnamese, said. ''It almost break my heart.''  Since the first group of children born to Asian mothers and American servicemen arrived in this country earlier this month, Mrs.  Grady and her husband Gary have grown increasingly impatient about bringing Tuan to the United States. Although the Gradys now have American entry papers and a copy of a Vietnamese exit visa issued to the boy, bureaucratic procedures have thwarted their efforts to speed his departure. The Vietnamese visa expires Tuesday.  Part of the problem is that Tuan's father, who was an Army medic stationed at a Saigon field hospital, did not sign his birth certificate, so the boy is a Vietnamese citizen who cannot emigrate as easily as Amerasian children who are documented United States citizens.  Trying to Find Father  The Gradys, who were married in 1974 when the child was almost 3 years old, have not been able to find Tuan's father.  ''The only thing I'd ask of the man is for him to put his name on the birth certificate to get him out,'' Mr. Grady said. ''We all make mistakes.''  The Gradys have been trying to get Tuan to the United States for years.  ''This has been a nightmare, trying to do this from 10,000 miles away,'' said Mr. Grady, a Coast Guard yeoman first class.  Telegrams from the boy's Vietnamese grandparents sometimes arrive garbled, and Mr. Grady said the agency at the United States Embassy in Bangkok that handles departures of refugees from Vietnam had taken up to a year to answer his letters.  State Dept. into Case  In a recent television appearance with Mr. Grady, H. Eugene Douglas, the American coordinator for refugee affairs, said his office at the State Department would look into the case. Laura Genero, his assistant, said in a telephone interview Thursday that she had received a cable from the embassy office, the Orderly Departures Program, saying Tuan's name was No. 1,169 on the ''F'' list, the fifth group to be given predeparture interviews by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  ''They might not reach Tuan's case for another four to six weeks,'' she said. She said that the agency had requested that the boy be included in the first group that left Vietnam Sept. 30, then in a group that left Oct. 7.  ''We don't know if they have been unable to find the boy, or whether they were unable to break the boy's case out of the bureaucratic processing mill,'' Miss Genero said.  ''I think now he'll be here in a couple of months, but then we thought that a couple of months ago,'' Mr. Grady said.  Mr. Grady met his wife when he was assigned to clerical duties in Saigon from Jan. 1972 to Jan. 1973. After their marriage, they said, they intended to bring the boy back, but because of the paper work involved, Mr. Grady ran out of both time and money to pay the Vietnamese lawyers. They left Tuan with Mrs. Grady's parents, whom they did not hear from for three years. When they did, Mr. Grady began appealing to numerous agencies for help. Michael S. Nebeker, an official of the Pearl S. Buck Foundation, which has been helping the Gradys, said he thought the Vietnamese wanted to solve the Amerasian problem quickly, and he expects many more children to leave soon. ''They need to get on with rebuilding their country, and this issue is standing in the way,'' he said in a telephone interview from Pennsylvania.

"   , Thailand, Dec. 21   Representatives of several American voluntary agencies have expressed concern that a new Federal law, meant to let thousands of Asian-born children of American fathers emigrate to the United States, may raise unintended difficulties, especially in the case of Vietnam. The law is due to go into effect on New Year's Day.  Speaking in interviews, the agency representatives said the law's provision for admitting the children alone - and not their mothers, guardians, brothers or sisters - could cause Hanoi to keep the children in Vietnam. They said also that the guardians might decide not to send their children to the United States or they might send them and break up their own families in the process.  Voluntary groups have recently been making the same points to the Departments of State and Justice in Washington because procedures for carrying out the law, which was passed Oct. 1 and signed by President Reagan, are still being drafted. In the interviews here, some representatives expressed doubt that their agencies would cooperate in carrying out the new law if families were regularly left behind.  The cooperation of the voluntary agencies is an explicit assumption of the legislation, which is meant to help children abandoned by or unknown to their American fathers. It provides that for admission to the United States, the child must have a guarantee of financial support for five years from either an American family or a private charitable agency.  Few Are Expected to Join Fathers  Amerasians admitted so far have been allowed into the United States under other regulations, many with relatives accompanying them, and a few have had widely publicized reunions with their fathers. Few of Vietnam's 8,000 to 10,000 Amerasians, however, are expected ever to become members of the families of their fathers in the United States.  Fifty-nine of the children have been ushered out of Vietnam since Sept. 30, some of them American citizens. Automatic citizenship will not be conferred under the new Amerasian law, which makes it easier for the children or their guardians to prove that they are the offspring of American soldiers or civilians.  Among those who expressed doubt about the cooperation of their agencies unless families were admitted as well was George R. Wagner, who works in Washington for the United States Catholic Conference and for the conference's International Catholic Migration Commission. He said ''the family problem'' also applied to the other countries within the new law's scope - Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and South Korea.  Mr. Wagner spoke here before he left Sunday to escort a group of 22 Vietnamese-American children and 12 relatives to the United States. They left Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City last Thursday.  The Other Groups  Doubts similar to Mr. Wagner's are being heard from the Pearl S.  Buck Foundation, Holt International Services, Save the Children and Church World Service. All these groups hope to help the Amerasians move to the United States.  One private American agency's representative said of a meeting in Ho Chi Minh City with senior Vietnamese officials last Thursday that it appeared ''that they're extremely anxious to move out the children and their relatives.'' He said that Cu Dinh Ba, head of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's North American desk, told the Americans that the children's mothers and families did not fit into Vietnamese society any better than the children did.  Another American at the meeting said Mr. Ba had been asked whether the children would be allowed to leave if the United States did not also take their families. Mr. Ba reportedly replied, ''It would be a matter for discussion.''  Washington and Hanoi conduct very few such talks because they have no diplomatic relations.  Douglas R. Beane, a representative of Church World Service, the relief arm of the National Council of Churches, said exclusion of families was ''a real problem.''  Michael Nebeker, director in Thailand for the Buck Foundation, said the Amerasian law contradicted an American policy favoring the admission of refugees with relatives in the United States.  ----  U.S. Works on Problems  Special to the New York Times  WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 - Laura Genero, assistant coordinator for refugees at the State Department, said today that the Reagan Administration expected to resolve the problems involving Amerasians in Vietnam ''in the next month or so.''  She said Powell Moore, Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations, sent a letter to Congress last week outlining a proposal to allow Amerasian children from Vietnam to enter with their mothers under procedures of the ''orderly departure program'' set up in 1979 for Vietnamese refugees.

"   , Thailand, March 31   Vietnam dropped six members from the ruling Politburo today, including Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, who is credited by the Vietnamese with defeating the French at Dien Bien Phu and the United States in the Vietnam War 20 years later.  The official Vietnam News Agency, which announced the changes, said that four newcomers to the Politburo included the commander of Vietnamese forces in Cambodia and a specialist in party organization. The announcement came on the final day of the fifth Vietnamese Communist Party congress in Hanoi.  A diplomat here who closely follows Vietnamese affairs said he thought that General Giap and former Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy Trinh, who also was dropped from the Politburo, had actually retired.  Yielded Defense Post in '80  General Giap, now 71 years old, was generally believed to have been the chief strategist in the Vietnamese victory over the French colonial forces at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, and then in the conflict with the United States. He is believed to have been ailing during the last years of the Indochina war. Two years ago he was replaced as Defense Minister by Gen. Van Tien Dung, who has now risen to sixth place in the Politburo.  Retaining their rankings in the 13-member body were Le Duan, the party chief, President Truong Chinh, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, Gen. Pham Hung, the commander in southern Vietnam, and Le Duc Tho, the chief ideologist.  During the congress, Mr. Duan attributed Vietnam's acute economic problems to mistakes of party and state agencies at all levels. He indicated that more purges and economic changes were ahead and voiced complete support for the foreign policy objectives of the Soviet Union.  Former Economic Chief Dropped  Ousted from eighth position and from the Central Committee was the former economic planning chief, Le Thang Nghi. He was replaced by Nguyen Lam as chairman of the planning commission in 1980, at the same time as it was announced that Vietnam's 1976-80 five-year plan had failed.  Tran Quoc Hoan, a former Interior Minister, was dropped from the No. 10 position.  A new appointment was Lieut. Gen. Le Duc Anh, who holds the 12th spot in the new lineup. He is commander of Vietnam's 200,000-man force in Cambodia and, according to the diplomatic analyst, reinforces the hard-liners in the Politburo headed by Le Duc Tho.

"      A senior Vietnamese official interviewed in a Polish newspaper has depicted his country with unusual candor as one troubled by grave military, economic and political problems.  The official, Hoang Tung, a secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party's Central Committee, told a correspondent of the Communist daily, Trybuna Ludu, in an interview published here on Monday that Vietnam was threatened directly by China, which he said is supported by the United States. The external threat, Mr. Tung said, is matched inside the country by supporters of the South Vietnamese regime that was defeated seven years ago.  Mr. Tung said ''classes'' connected with the former Saigon Government, though overthrown, had not yet been completely destroyed. He also said the existence of ''more than a million people formerly closely connected'' with the old regime ''complicates the social situation.''  ''To a large extent we have liquidated the burgeoisie as a class, but former property owners continue to live among us and even now still have a sense of their own strength,'' the party official said.  Ethnic Chinese Attacked  He added that many of the former entrepreneurs were members of the ethnic Chinese minority and charged that they were linked to a global ''network'' that was conducting economic war against Vietnam. He referred to alleged smuggling of goods into Vietnam from Bangkok, Hong Kong and Singapore.  Foreign residents and visitors tend to believe that the goods sent into Vietnam from abroad and traded largely on the black market have provided the people of Vietnam's cities with the margin of survival while the official, Government-run sector is unable to meet basic needs.  Mr. Tung accused China and other enemies of Vietnam of conducting what he characterized as ''small war'' against his country. He described this as consisting of ''continuous tension'' created by Chinese military strength on Vietnam's northern border and the fomenting of partisan movements in Cambodia and Laos.  Vietnamese troops are stationed in both of those neighboring countries, whose weak regimes are considered dependent on Hanoi. Mr.  Tung's assertion that partisan movements in Laos and Cambodia are part of a war against Vietnam appeared to be an admission of his country's predominance over the two countries.  Economically, the Vietnamese official said, ''small war'' consists of the creating of ''economic confusion and disorganization'' of the Vietnamese market by the overseas Chinese.  'Economic Blockade' Charged  Furthermore, Mr. Tung charged, an ''economic blockade'' is being carried out against Vietnam. Presumably, he meant the suspension of various Western and Japanese economic aid programs in retaliation for Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1979 and its continuing occupation of that country.  The Vietnamese official said the three principal tasks facing the Hanoi Government were defense, feeding the population and laying the foundations of a socialist system. While southern Vietnam has been Communist for only seven years, the northern half of the country has been Communist since 1954 and governed by a socialist system that even Eastern European Communists consider of excessively doctrinaire rigor.  Referring to Vietnam's serious food shortages, Mr. Tung said that balancing defense requirements against food needs ''has influenced the standard of living.'' But he added, ''When even the United States has the dilemma of cannons versus butter, why shouldn't we have a dilemma, arms versus rice?''  Acknowledging ''serious difficulties in everyday life,'' Mr. Tung asserted that the Vietnamese were not meat eaters and accepted an annual consumption level of 22 pounds a person. The assertion, which is not supported by knowledge of Vietnamese eating habits, caused a Pole to remark that the only purpose of publishing the interview was to persuade Poles that some countries were even worse off than Poland.

"    FRANCISCO   The Anh Dao Vietnamese restaurant on a busy street in San Jose was nearly filled with 40 to 50 people on a clear day last January when two men, one slender and quick, the other stocky and muscular, walked in the door.  One posted himself at the entrance while the other strode to a table where eight Vietnamese were eating lunch. As he neared the table, the police account continues, the muscular young man pulled a pistol from his pocket, aimed at a man at the table, fired twice, turned and walked out the restaurant with his partner at the door.  They stepped into a waiting car and sped away. The victim was dead in his chair.  Although the police have identified two suspects, both 22-year-old Vietnamese, neither has been captured.  The slaying is one of a series of similar outbreaks among Vietnamese in Southern and Central California that point to widespread gang activity based on extortion. Law-enforcement officials now say that extortion has become a way of life in the growing Vietnamese communities in California and elsewhere in the United States.  Usually Physical Threats  The extortion, generally aimed at small merchants, most often takes the form of physical threats, but sometimes political blackmail is involved, such as labeling the victim a Communist sympathizer, a serious matter among the often violently anti-Communist Vietnamese who have settled here.  ''It is extremely serious,'' said a police intelligence source in Garden Grove in Southern California. In that town, a pair of gunmen in ski masks invaded a Vietnamese restaurant, the Hoang-My, last September and opened fire with a shotgun at a table of diners, killing a Vietnamese woman and wounding six others in what was described by the police as ''a classic gangland incident.''  Among those at the table who escaped without injury was a man whom the police said was under investigation for activity across southern California, a man said to have at one time been an ''enforcer'' for the Saigon police.  Two days after the Garden Grove killing, the body of a young Vietnamese who had been shot in the head and bound in a blanket was found in a canyon in San Diego. There have been others of a similar nature.  'Still in Its Infancy'  ''We're dealing with something that is still in its infancy,'' said the Garden Grove police intelligence officer, ''but within five years it will be extremely serious.''  There are indications, he said, that a criminal network involving Vietnamese operates in other parts of the Western United States, but he offered no details.  ''Understand that the Vietnamese culture is mobile,'' said Lieut.  Wyatt Hart of the Orange County Sheriff's Department, discussing the hiring of people for killings. ''You have some in Texas, you have some in San Jose, San Francisco, L.A., Orange County, recently in San Diego. There is a place in Texas you can go to get someone to come down here and hit someone and go back and hide out. Maybe Houston, San Antonio. We have people come down from San Jose to Orange County make hits, we have people in Orange County go to L.A. to make hits.''  ''We are used to some pretty rough gangs in the United States,'' he said. ''They would all look like little choirboys compared with the Vietnamese gangs.''  Because of almost universal fear of police authority among Vietnamese, apparently based on experiences with corrupt and violent police and military officials in Vietnam, the police here have been largely stalemated in efforts to fight the problem. The extortion, they say, almost never results in an official complaint.  Role of Politics Unclear  In some cases, police and other sources report, some gang leaders have military backgrounds in Vietnam and adopt military names such as the Frogmen or the Paratroopers. Some purportedly strike a militantly anti-Communist pose, although police officials say they have no firm idea of what role, if any, politics might play in gang activity.  The problem with extortion gangs was essentially imported from Vietnam, where it ''is almost a way of life,'' said Lieutenant Hart, and it is widespread in the Vietnamese merchant community.  He said, ''We ran a survey not too long ago in which we went down one street in the Vietnamese area, eight or 10 blocks on both sides, 20 to 30 businesses, and there were only two on that entire street that were not paying protection. But you don't hear about it because of their experience with the uniform; they don't trust uniforms because of their experience in Vietnam.''  'Someone Is Going to Pay a Visit'  ''And even if they did trust us, they are told the gang has 20 members,'' he said, ''and 'The police can't protect you; you can rest assured that someone is going to pay you a visit.' And they know damn well that is going to happen.''  In San Jose, which has a sizable Vietnamese community, the Police Department has begun a radio program in Vietnamese to explain that the police in the United States are there to help them, not exploit them.  Victims of extortion, said the San Jose Police Chief, Joseph McNamara, may feel that some of the people involved in the extortion ''are tied into the government and are therefore outside the law.'' ''Some of them may not make the distinction between people in the United States and the Vietnamese Government,'' he said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 28 1982 ,0
"   , Vietnam, May 29   Vietnam released information today about four American soldiers who were believed killed in the Vietnam War and said more bodies of dead soldiers would be returned to the United States.  The information was given to a group of six Vietnam veterans and three other Americans who arrived in the capital Friday.  The Hanoi Government also announced that in the future it would deal with the veterans' group, and not with the United States Government, on questions involving 2,500 American servicemen whose fates in the Vietnam War are still unresolved.  Names Listed for 4  A Vietnamese spokesman gave the names of four Americans who had been listed as missing in action in Vietnam and said that the bodies of four or five other Americans had been found.  Only one of the eight or nine reported sets of physical evidence included both a body and an identity card. The body was said to be that of Lieut. (j.g.) Donald Patrick Frye.  The Vietnamese Government said Lieutenant Frye was believed killed on July 19, 1967, in the province now known as Ha Nam Ninh, south of Hanoi. The province is the product of a merger of the former provinces of Ha Nam and Ninh Binh.  Three other American servicemen, whose identification cards but not bodies were turned over to the veterans, were listed as Joe R.  Mossman, Hestle Roosevelt and Knapp Fredrick Woodrow.  No Information Provided  The Vietnamese provided no other information except to say that the three name tags were found in the three provinces of Ngha Tinh, Bac Thai and Binh Tri Thien.  Bac Thai Province is north of Hanoi. Ngha Tinh and Binh Tri Thien Provinces are along a central strip of Vietnam, from north of the city of Vinh to a few miles below the former South Vietnamese city of Hue.  A Vietnamese spokesman said that ''three or four'' other unidentified bodies had been discovered in Ha Nam Ninh Province and that another body believed to be that of an American had been found in Quang Ninh Province, which stretches northeast from Haiphong to the Chinese border.  It was not clear when the bodies would be turned over to the veterans.  Vietnamese Cites Ingratitude  The last bodies of American soldiers to have been turned over by the Vietnamese were three that were returned to the United States last July. Vietnam's chief negotiator with the veterans, Viet Ngo Minh, said today that the ingratitude shown then by Washington had helped persuade Hanoi to deal with the veterans rather than with Washington.  The veterans were invited by the Vietnamese Government on a weeklong visit after a similar trip last December. The announcement about the return of the bodies was made to a small number of Western newspaper and television reporters after a closed three-hour meeting between the veterans and the Vietnamese.  The reporters were granted visas to cover the veterans' trip.  Mr. Minh said the bodies were discovered in the last few months, after a United States Defense Department team left Hanoi last February. The team, led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, came to Hanoi to inquire about Americans missing in action. It left with an agreement that the Vietnamese would send experts to Hawaii to study the technical aspects of identification.  Mr. Minh said today that the experts might still go to Hawaii in August.  The American veterans and their lawyer and the theatrical producer Joseph Papp, who joined the trip to promote cultural exchanges between Vietnam and the United States, were later received by Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach.  Mr. Armitage's mission was not received by Mr. Thach.  ----  U.S. Accepts Hanoi's Move  Special to the New York Times  WASHINGTON, May 29 - The Defense Department issued a statement today in reaction to the report that the Hanoi Government planned to deal with the veterans' group on matters concerning the fate of missing American servicemen.  ''We believe the resolution of the M.I.A. accounting issue depends on Government-to-Government cooperation, but the U.S. Government is willing to accept remains from whatever source,'' the statement said.

"    PRANAY B.GUPTE is a Times correspondent based in Nairobi.  BY PRANAY B.GUPTE  W hen South Vietnam was overrun by the North Vietnamese in 1974, Do Dac Loc, South Vietnam's Ambassador to the Ivory Coast, his wife and their six children stayed on in Abidjan, and thousands of Ivorians, Frenchmen and other nationals are delighted that they did. For the Loc family operates a first-rate Vietnamese restaurant in the bustling tropical capital in West Africa.  Abidjan, probably the most prosperous city in all of black Africa, has excellent French, Ivorian and Chinese restaurants by the score and residents of the city have fussy palates. Yet even the most demanding Abidjani food critic applauds after a meal at Mr. Loc's establishment, Le Dalat.  Vietnam starts at the gate of the one-story bungalow that Mr. Loc has built at 12 Rue Paris in the Plateau section of Abidjan (telephone 327950; reservations are advised because only about 25 diners can be accommodated at any one time). There are Vietnamese motifs outside and displays of Vietnamese porcelain and paintings inside. Each table, covered with crisp Ivorian linen, has a vase of freshly cut flowers from Mr. Loc's garden. There is no piped-music and the air-conditioning is correctly adjusted for the constant humidity.  The time it takes to serve dishes is calibrated differently for lunch and for dinner: At lunchtime, service is so swift that it reminds one of fast-food restaurants in the United States. Since the restaurant is situated in the heart of Abidjan's busy commercial section, dozens of office workers and executives, as well as diplomats, crowd Le Dalat at lunch.  Practically every dish on the menu is good, but here are some suggestions. To start with, try the soupe d'abalone with transparent vermicelli. At lunchtime, this soup, which is served in an enormous bowl, can be a meal in itself.  After the soup, nems are a favorite. They are Vietnamese egg rolls stuffed with meat, usually pork. There is a special way to eat a nem: Take a small lettuce leaf, place some mint shreds on it, then wrap the lettuce around the roll, dunk it first in chili sauce and next in a sweetish relish and pop it into your mouth.  The main course might be crevettes maison or crevettes sauce piquante, both shrimps with sauce. Boeuf aux ananas (beef with pineapple) is sauted or pan-fried, depending on your preference.  Poulet amande (chicken with almonds) is another recommended dish. It comes with a sauce that contains mint and a dash of curry. Porc a la citronnelle is shredded pork immersed in a hill of lemon sauce and mint leaves.  The main courses should be eaten with rice, preferably simple boiled rice rather than fried rice.  For the first-time visitor, it's a bit of a shock to see a Vietnamese restaurant in Africa. Somehow, Chinese, Malagasy, Thai or Creole restaurants - to name a few that grace this city of one million people - seem not to draw sighs of surprise. But the Ivory Coast has been a haven for the politically dispossessed for many years, as long as they are not Communist, and it has been offering sanctuary to an increasing number of Vietnamese since 1974. In that year, the Loc family was one of five Vietnamese families in Abidjan. Now there are more than 3,000 Vietnamese men, women and children and a dozen Vietnamese restaurants.  The children serve as waiters. Mr. Loc and his wife prepare the 70 dishes offered daily on the menu, which is printed on beige ricepaper. A couple can dine and wine well for about $20.  The Vietnamese have been drawn to the Ivory Coast, in part, because they share the Ivorians's French heritage. Also, the climate is tropical and humid, much like Vietnam's. And because of the economic boom - induced by the Ivory Coast's new-found oil wealth and by vast amounts of French investment - opportunities are increasingly available in service industries, such as catering. So these days it is not uncommon to see Vietnamese faces behind counters in stores, behind the wheels of taxis and behind the cash registers of such restaurants as Le Dalat, which have prospered.

"    FRANCISCO   Vietnamese refugees in California and other parts of the country are holding rallies to raise money and recruit volunteers for guerrilla resistance to the Communist government in Vietnam.  A recent rally in a convention center in San Jose, Calif., drew about 2,500 Vietnamese, including about 300 men whose khaki uniforms were described by a rally organizer as belonging to ''overseas forces in the Bay area.''  On April 17, a similar rally in Anaheim, Calif., was attended by about 3,000 people, including Nguyen Cao Ky, the former South Vietnamese Premier and Vice President who now operates liquor stores in Huntington Beach, Calif. Huntington Beach is in Orange County, where an estimated 70,000 Vietnamese refugees live.  Other rallies have been held in Houston, Dallas, Denver and Washington, D.C., according to the San Jose organizers. Some 40,000 to 50,000 Vietnamese refugees live in San Jose and surrounding Santa Clara County.  Aid to Resistance Movement  Behind the rallies is a group calling itself the Committee for Support of the Resistance Movement in Vietnam.  At the San Jose rally, a man who gave his name as Lieu Pham said he was coordinator of the overseas operation. He added that the money collected would go ''to the front'' in Vietnam.  Tran Minh Cong, another organizer of the San Jose rally, said that the guerrilla resistance in Vietnam was being led by 52-year-old Hoang Co Minh, a former admiral in the Vietnamese navy who left the United States a year ago to return to Vietnam. At the rally, the former admiral was referred to as the general of the National United Front for the Liberation of Vietnam.  ''We want to show our support for the resistance in Vietnam,'' he said, ''to liberate our people from the tyrannical regime of Communist Vietnam. Refugees here and all over the world would like to support the resistance forces one way or another. It can be moral support; it can be physical support - and by that I mean financial.''  Unwilling to Give Figures  Organizers of the San Jose rally would not say how many, if any, Vietnamese were volunteering for service in the resistance movement, or whether any military training was under way. ''We do not really want to disclose our strength right now,'' said Mr. Cong, who is also president of the Vietnamese League of Orange County.  There have been reports from Vietnam that there are about 200 guerrilla fighters under the command of Hoang Co Minh in Vietnam. In addition, there has been continued resistance in Vietnam's Mekong Delta to the Communist regime. The dissidents have been led in part by an anti-Communist reform Buddhist sect called Hoa Hao.  Regardless of their size, the fervor of the refugee rallies in California and elsewhere in support of the resistance movement in Vietnam illustrates the depth of anti-Communist feeling among Vietnamese here.  ''Those who choose not to support the resistance movement, I think that number would be very, very small,'' said Mr. Cong.  The ferment here comes on the eve of a trial in the murder of Lam Trong Duong, a young leftist who was shot to death on a busy street last July 21.  Although the police believe the motive for the slaying was personal and an acquaintance of Mr. Lam'ssaid to have been seen talking with him has been charged with the murder, sources familiar with the Vietnamese community say that many believe politics was behind the shooting.  After the death, a group calling itself the Anti-Communist Viets Organisation,claimed responsibility for the slaying.  Newsletter Challenged  A letter postmarked from Las Vegas accused Mr. Lam, who was editor of a community newsletter published here, of ''odious crimes against Vietnamese people'' in publishing the newslettter. it said that the newsletter existed ''to bolster the image of the hated VN Communist regime.'' The letter, whose postmark was indistinct, it appeared to have reached the post office eight hours after the shooting.  ''AVCO has decided,'' the letter, referring to the anti-Communist organization, continued, ''to punish Lam Trong Duong. The punishment has been carried out by AVCO's shock squad on July 21, 1981, in San Francisco, USA.''  A somewhat similar letter was received by a Vietnamese publication in Garden Grove, Calif., the next week. Called ''Announcement 2,'' it reiterated the charges and said that as a result ''the Vietnamese Organization for Communist Extermination decided to declare the death penalty'' and that the ''sentence was carried out by a member of VOCE in San Francisco.''  Seventeen days after the burial last July 24, according to a funeral home source who asked not to named, Mr. Lam's father asked that the body be exhumed. The next month a permit was issued to exhume the body and it was cremated. According to the funeral home source, Mr. Lam's family stated that the ashes would be scattered at sea, three miles west of Half Moon Bay in the Pacific Ocean.  A friend of the family told the police that the exhumation resulted from pressure on the family to remove the body from a cemetery where other Vietnamese were buried.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, June 3   Scores of children and adolescents of mixed American and Vietnamese parentage were camped outside the Cuu Long Hotel today to sell peanuts to a party of visiting Vietnam War veterans from the United States and some American reporters.  They also begged, posed for photographs, laughed if the visitors smiled, stared somberly, and occasionally scattered when a khaki-clad policeman or some other government agent stabbed his finger down the boulevard and told them to go away.  There are uncounted thousands of the offspring of American fathers and Vietnamese mothers in Vietnam. Most live in Ho Chi Minh City.  About 70 such children have been declared by the State Department to be United States citizens, able to pick up their passports at any consulate. Yet none of the 70, none of about 500 others whose American paternity has been established, and none who have appealed over the past two years to Vietnamese and American authorities, have actually left Vietnam.  According to American and other Western experts, the obstacles range from United States law to inaction or obstruction by the Vietnamese, from the technical difficulties of establishing paternity to the lack of a clear American sense of what if anything the United States should do for such children.  Many Want to Go to U.S.  Other problems include the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, the fact that letters go astray in Vietnam, the mixed feelings of some American fathers toward the prospect of becoming involved with their children, most of whom are illegitimate, and the question of whether mothers should accompany the children if they are ever admitted to the United States.  What is clear is that large numbers of such families want to go to the United States. Life for them, as for many Vietnamese, is poor and unemployment is high. It has also been reported that the children have suffered official discrimination - for both racial and political reasons - in schools, jobs and welfare programs.  Such discrimination, however, is extremely hard to measure, according to European and American officials in the Orderly Departure Program.  Contacts with a dozen or so such children over the past few days reveal only that some are frail and sickly and others strong and healthy, some are withdrawn and others boisterous and streetwise. A few revealed themselves to be literate in Vietnamese, but none spoke more than a few words of English.  Records of 4,000 Compiled  Two or three adolescents said that their families managed, one way or another, to bring in the equivalent of $15 to $20 a month, more than many other Vietnamese families earn. Others were dressed in tattered shorts and ripped shirts. Yet ragged clothes are a common sight all over Ho Chi Minh City.  Since the inauguration of the Orderly Departure Program for Vietnam two years ago, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the American Embassy in Bangkok have compiled records of about 4,000 children of American-Vietnamese background out of a total that may run to 10,000 or twice that many. Most of the cases were initiated by mothers, other relatives or guardians; the number of true orphans is unknown.  Several bills pending in Congress would make it easier for some of these children to enter the United States. The general intent of the bills appears to be supported by the Reagan Administration and the private delegation of Vietnam War veterans that left here for New York today after a six-day visit praised them in meetings with Vietnamese officials.  Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told the veterans in Hanoi that ''all'' children of mixed American and Vietnamese background could leave Vietnam. Later, however, officials said at lower levels, but more formally, that the children could go if their fathers ''accepted'' them and if the program for dealing with them was ''simple.''  American officials involved in the Orderly Departure Program said many fathers are discouraged by state laws from accepting them, or the fathers are dead or cannot be found, or, most commonly, that while they might be willing to claim paternity they do not want to take the children into their homes.  Still the Children Hope  The proposed laws typically offer asylum to the Vietnamese children of American military personnel, but not of American contractors, Government employees and others who worked in Vietnam in the 1960's and 1970's.  Evidently these tangles have not kept the children from hoping. One day last week, while the delegation from the Vietnam Veterans of America was discussing the problem in a closed meeting with Do Duy Lien, deputy chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, dozens of them, some on bicycles, began gathering at the end of Nguyen Hue Street outside the meeting place, a palace that used to be Saigon's municipal hall.  To some, the presence of Americans seemed an occasion for high jinks and determined poses in the rain. Most, however, were silent.  A mother approached with three children fathered, she said, by three different Americans, one a soldier, the others civilians. She said she had applied for American visas, but had not received them.  She then wrote her name and case number and her children's names in a reporter's notebook. As she was writing, a young policeman approached and demanded to see the notebook.  He soon returned it and left, and the woman continued her appeal.  Later she approached the foreigners more cautiously.

"    The Vietnamese economy is in a shambles and Communists and Western economists, in varying degrees, cite war and the huge military establishment as primary causes. But even Vietnamese leaders are beginning to concede that part of the blame must be placed upon government mismanagement, rigid policies, lack of popular support, official corruption and general weariness.  Signs of deep trouble are everywhere. City streets are full of people with little to do but walk, sit or ride their bikes. Consumer goods are extraordinarily scarce, even more so in orthodox Hanoi than in Ho Chi Minh City, an incorrigible center of enterprise. The best hotels cannot find light bulbs. Apartments in a six-year-old housing complex lack running water.  Vietnam reported it produced 15 million tons of food grains last year. The performance, largely a result of allowing some private farmers in the south to sell in an expanded free market, was an improvement over previous years, when floods and other calamities necessitated millions of tons of rice and wheat imports. But imports were sharply reduced to pay the suddenly tripled price of Sovietsupplied oil and Vietnamese nutrition suffered - the people are thin. United Nations experts report most get insufficient calories.  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has suffered repeated failures in industrial projects. Lack of raw materials, spare parts, competent managers and engineers has caused even Communist aid missions to demand fundamental changes. Non-Communist aid missions voiced similar complaints before World Bank, Japanese and much other aid was frozen after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978.  The most frustrated donor may be Sweden, after a decade of trying to get a computerized $500 million paper mill going at Bai Bang, north of Hanoi. Despite the labors of more than 600 Swedes billeted in an air-conditioned village, the facility is still not fully operational and Sweden is absorbing the costs. Vietnam has extensive forests but pulp is being shipped in from Sweden, Western diplomats said.  Technicians and diplomats from Eastern Europe have lately admitted to similar frustrations. A Hungarian-backed shoe factory reportedly turns out shoes too shoddy for export. East German technicians at a textile project in Da Nang, a European diplomat said, were arrested after coming to blows with Vietnamese co-workers over how to run things. Nikolai K. Baibakov, chairman of the Soviet state planning committee, is said to have demanded unsuccessfully in Hanoi last fall that Soviet managers be placed in charge of all Soviet projects.  Money and Oil Shortages  Exports last year dropped while prices increased for imported oil, fabric for the textile industry, machinery and most other necessities. Hanoi's foreign currency reserves stood at exactly zero by February of this year, according to a confidential April 29 report by the International Monetary Fund. As of last Dec. 31, it was $38 million behind in payments to non-Communist lenders.  After sharp economic declines in 1979 and 1980, last year was a good one for rice, light industry and some cash crops. But ''such key industries as steel, fertilizer, textiles and cement showed significant declines, mainly because of poor management and continued shortages of raw materials and spare parts,'' the fund said. For lack of payment, Iraq has stopped supplying oil. Aviation fuel is short; flights between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City have been cut back. Loans from Libya and Algeria have been rescheduled. A $30 million textile project financed by Italy, Belgium and West Germany is near collapse.  Official statements continue to blame the grim picture on ''30 years of war,'' American bombings, the destruction of agricultural land by defoliants and the death or dislocation of millions of people. They also point to hostile China, requiring Vietnam to keep large numbers of troops (as many as 40 divisions, intelligence sources say) on the Chinese border and in Cambodia. Hanoi also blames its troubles on United States actions in drying up international aid and on domestic ''reactionaries,'' including ethnic Chinese and southerners irreparably corrupted, it says, by the former United States presence.  But Western analysts, increasingly joined by European Communists, stress managerial difficulties. The state-run economy, although less centralized and less fond of heavy industry than before 1979, they say, is still clumsy, slow to make decisions, inflexible on prices, indifferent to export opportunities based on cheap labor, oblivious to quality controls and innocent of the rigors of international trade. Managers are said to be unwilling to take responsibility; workers lack incentives. Western governments, defending their aid cutoff, point to the drain on the economy of the Cambodia occupation. The military absorbs much of the scarce supply of administrators and technicians. (Unlike the Vietnamese, few Western analysts believe that hundreds of thousands of soldiers could easily be transformed into useful workers.)  Criticism by foreign Communists, Western creditors and many angry Vietnamese may be taking effect. The longtime officials and old warriors who run the country may be ready to loosen the economic reins a bit. Vietnamese officials have admitted to Western visitors, moreover, that ''socialist transformation'' of the south - including collectivized farming - will take longer than expected. And Sweden reportedly is being allowed to take control of its monumental paper mill.  Officials have also been telling Westerners that poor countries, socialist or not, lack economic and technical expertise, and that the earlier political purges of experts in the south may have been a mistake. They speak of dreadful bureaucrats, opportunists in the party, the importance of family planning (the population is 55 million and growing at least 2.4 percent a year) and the need to recruit young party members. Occasionally, they even acknowledge what impresses many visitors as widespread weariness behind their good cheer and good manners - cynicism toward the Government and impatience to reap the benefits of peace. ''They are on their kness,'' said a European diplomat in Hanoi. ''I think they will have to make changes soon, to become less rigid.''  His opinion is widely shared among Westerners in Hanoi. But other observers point to the entrenched realities of state planning and poverty, and the declaration at the Fifth Communist Party Congress in March that the socialist transformation of the south must inevitably, albeit more carefully, proceed. Nearly all analysts, Vietnamese and foreign, well-wishers and enemies, agree that the economic crisis is authentic. Most believe that mastering it will require profound reforms. Colin Campbell, a correspondent forbased in Bangkok, Thailand, recently accompanied a group of American veterans on a visit to Vietnam.

"    Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam offered in a television interview broadcast yesterday to free all inmates of his country's labor detention camps if the United States would accept them.  ''I can give all of them to America if America would like to have them - all of them!'' Mr. Thach said in an interview that took place in Vietnam last week and was broadcast last night on the CBS News program ''60 Minutes.''  Asked if his offer was a promise, Mr. Thach said: ''Yes. Today you can sign with me an agreement and you could bring them back to the United States.''  The London-based human rights organization Amnesty International has said that tens of thousands of Vietnamese are detained in labor re-education camps.  Most are believed to be Vietnamese who had ties to the United States or to the South Vietnamese Government.  CBS News quoted a State Department official as saying the United States had indicated a readiness to accept a thousand eligible Vietnamese refugees each month under a program negotiated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  ''Many Vietnamese now held in re-education camps probably would be eligible and many have been accepted for this program because of their special ties to the U.S.,'' the official said, ''but Hanoi has not issued them exit permits.''

"      The State Department accused the Vietnamese Government today of foot-dragging on the expatriation of thousands of inmates at labor detention camps, many of whom are eligible to come to the United States.  A spokesman, Dean Fischer, addressed the issue after Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam said over the weekend that all such inmates would be freed if the United States would accept them.  Mr. Fischer suggested the Vietnamese had been less forthcoming in their dealings with United Nations refugee officials who have been serving as intermediaries between Hanoi and Washington.  Many Vietnamese now held in re-education camps probably would be eligible for consideration and many have been accepted for United States resettlement ''but Hanoi has not issued them exit permits,''Mr. Fischer said.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   A pedicab pusher, noticing two curious young men walking alongside his small vehicle, tells his passenger, ''Watch.'' He means the wristwatch: keep it out of sight.  You look around and in many ways the people resemble those in any number of sprawling cities in poor hot countries where there aren't nearly enough jobs, where even the apartment houses built in the 1960's are decaying, where clothes are simple and where, in the crowded market districts, the world seems a sullen hubbub.  But few people wear watches.  The Cuu Long Hotel here still serves cold Pabst Blue Ribbon beer.  At Hanoi's best hotel, the Thang Loi, the beer is mostly warm and nameless.  The Cuu Long is still known widely as the Majestic. And some Government officials still start to say ''Saigon.'' There are no rats in the Cuu Long's fifth-floor dining room, as there are in the dining room of the Thang Loi in Hanoi. And the view from the fifth floor is magnificent up and down the Saigon River.  When a squall comes up, the palms shake, and the rusting ships beside the quay look almost shipshape behind gray sheets of rain.  Even the hotel's telex works much of the time. When it doesn't work, according to a Western communications expert in Hanoi, the reason is often that Ho Chi Minh City's central telex office has stuck stubbornly to the same radio frequency despite a change in atmospheric conditions.  Switching frequencies requires formal approval from Hanoi.  In a public park a poor woman cooks her lunch over a tiny fire. She seems oblivious to anyone watching her.On the steps of a stone statue inscribed ''An Duong Vuong,'' a band of gap-toothed youths and sprawling women in hair curlers, laughing, call out mockingly to a stranger.  ''This is the society you created,'' a Government official comments later, referring to the United States.  Apart from oblivion, however, and come-hither mockery, reactions to an American range from stares, to winks, to lifted eyebrows and a funny greeting like ''hey.''  An amused cowboy on his motorcycle, the bill of his cap pulled squarely over his dark glasses, gave an inexplicable thumbs-up.  But the strangest look comes from a young man sitting on a curb. He is dressed in fatigues and wears the floppy-brimmed green hat once worn by American and South Vietnamese soldiers. His cheeks are hollows, his face expressionless, his eyes black. He looks like a ghost, and may be no less unhappy for his self-consciousness.  Young ladies wear gloves, despite the heat, as they ride their bicycles down the boulevards. Others appear to have camped out semipermanently on the boulevards' roundabouts and medians.  A parked line of American cars, with tailfins, circa 1957, painted red, wait for something along Nguyen Hue Street. Some of the city's public buses are Dodges.  The Coca-Cola signs, by contrast, have been painted over, but you can still buy fresh Kodak film on the black market.  At the low tables in innumerable small coffee houses, opened to the street, people sit for hours, as if rooted to their chairs.  Six months ago, according to one resident, some cafes here offered music at night, but then the musical cafes closed down. Like an estimated 80 percent of southern Vietnam's economic life, they were privately owned. Recently, new versions of the same cafes have opened, and under many of the same managers - but under Government auspices.  By day the shabby cafes are quiet places, and although their customers are known to tell tales in them against the Government, they also sit and watch.  On the street, there is a motorcycle accident, and then a brief traffic jam of trucks and bicycles and pedicabs. A child is arrested by a plainclothes policeman, apparently for shoplifting. The citizens pass by. Women chat with their friends in front of a vegetable stand before buying a few small items. Cigarettes are being offered from countless glass-topped boxes on legs. Cookies for sale from pushcarts.  Madame Dai's restaurant is out of the ordinary. It is tucked into the back room of a once-elegant house along a side street shaded by tall trees during the day and sunk in extraordinary gloom at night.  The Vietnamese are small users of electricity.  But Madame Dai, portly, brilliant and gray-haired, greets her visitors as if they were ambassadors, and her well-lit dining room is so unabashedly ancien regime that even a Communist Party visitor from Hanoi soon softens.  Dusty leather-bound lawbooks line the walls. Most are in French and her copies of ''The Palace Journal of Jurisprudence and Legislation'' date back to at least 1909.  ''I am a lawyer,'' Madame Dai says civilly. She adds, when pressed, ''until 1975,'' when she opened her restaurant.  She would rather not speak English, which she says she speaks badly and which the man from Hanoi speaks well, and instead she rattles on graciously with some European customers.  There are five customers altogether, plus a boy who is studying intently at a table stacked with books, plus many cats. The glasses sparkle.  The man from Hanoi - amid so much worldliness, and after a bowl of soup, a lobster taxied in fresh from the sea, a shish kebab, flan, coffee and several drinks - asks an American what the Americans - ''the people'' - really think about Vietnam.  Not much these days, in his interlocutor's opinion.  ''Are they repressing the war?'' asks the man from Hanoi.  Some, no doubt; but most probably have more immediate things to think about.  Plainly curious beneath his certainties, the man suggests that his country may be somewhat isolated.  One thing that makes a visitor feel that Ho Chi Minh City is somehow occupied territory - even Hanoi admits that ''integration'' has been difficult - is the petitioners. They are everywhere, they want to get out, and there are more of them than the Vietnamese mothers who bring you their photostats of American identification cards.  Male. Thirty-six. A former reporter for South Vietnam's news agency. No longer allowed to work. Married. Two children.  A man who says he is Chinese, with a Nationalist Chinese passport.

"      The United States Navy destroyer Turner Joy, which figured in an incident critical to American involvement in the Vietnam War 18 years ago, was fired on again Sunday night by Vietnamese ships, the Defense Department disclosed tonight.  The Turner Joy and three other American warships were passing through the South China Sea from Thailand toward the Philippines when the Turner Joy was fired on by a machine gun mounted on a large Vietnamese fishing vessel, officials said. A second Vietnamese vessel also reportedly fired on the Turner Joy.  One shot pierced the ship, officials said, but no one was hurt and no damage was done. When another American destroyer, the Lynde McCormick, fired shots from a 50-caliber machine gun over the top of the Vietnamese vessel, the Vietnamese stopped shooting, the officials said.  The officials said the four ships were 70 miles south of the nearest point on the Vietnamese mainland and 20 miles south of the island of Con Son. Vietnam claims a 12-mile territorial limit and an additional 12-mile security area, according to the Defense Department. The United States recognizes a three-mile territorial limit.  Tonkin Gulf Incident Recalled  In the summer of 1964, the Turner Joy and another destroyer were reported to have been fired on by North Vietnamese patrol boats as they were steaming in the Gulf of Tonkin, off North Vietnam.  President Johnson used that incident to persuade Congress to adopt the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that empowered him to mount a largescale military intervention in Vietnam.  The latest sea skirmish began Sunday evening at about 9:30, according to officials here. The Vietnamese vessel fired two red flares across the bow of the Turner Joy, then opened up with a machine gun. The Lynde McCormick immediately came up to investigate and fired back with what naval officers said was a minimum use of force.  The ships, which included the cruiser Sterett and a third destroyer, the Benjamin Stoddert, remained in the area during the night to determine the identity of the hostile vessels during daylight Monday morning.  When the light was sufficient, the Sterett closed to about 3,000 yards from one of the Vietnamese vessels, which fired with a machine gun. The American ships then moved out of range and made two full circles of the Vietnamese vessels. They reported seeing a Vietnamese flag being hauled down.  Shortly after, the four ships broke off and steamed toward the United States Naval base at Subic Bay in the Philippines.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",June 23 1982 ,0
"      A State Department official said today that the Reagan Administration was working with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees ''to determine whether the Vietnamese are in fact prepared to release persons from re-education camps for resettlement abroad.''  The official estimated that there were about 100,000 people in socalled re-educatiom camps, many of them confined because of past ties to the United States. The official said that ''significant'' numbers of these Vietnamese could be absorbed into the United States, because Hanoi's orderly departure program, under which Vietnamese are allowed to leave the country, has been kept down.  Under the program, 1,000 Vietnamese are allowed to leave Vietnam for the United States each month. Since October, however, the figure has averaged 332, according to State Department officials.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 15   Four Americans looking for relatives missing in the Vietnam War said today that they had found the wreckage, in Laos, of an Air Force C-130 and the remains of its crew, convincing a Florida woman that her husband was dead.  Ann Hart, of Pensacola, Fla., part of the first group of private United States citizens to search for Americans missing in action, said in a telephone interview that she was convinced that her husband, Maj.

"      The police say they are investigating the possibility that the unsolved slaying of a Vietnamese newspaper editor here last month was in retaliation for one or more of the editor's articles.  The editor, Nguyen Dam Thong, 48 years old, was shot to death outside his home Aug. 24. Shortly before the slaying, friends and relatives said, Mr. Thong received numerous threats about his articles. His wife said she had been unable to revive her husband's biweekly newspaper because the threats, now directed toward her, had continued.  ''We don't know anything for sure and we don't have any specific suspects,'' a Houston homicide detective, J.@W. Ellis, said. ''But he sure made a lot of enemies with that paper and there doesn't seem to be many other possible motives.''  The killing has raised considerable concern among leaders of the approximately 40,000 Vietnamese who live here because Mr. Thong was the third Vietnamese editor to have been slain or shot at in this country in slightly over a year. The community leaders said the attacks were part of a growing incidence of violence among Vietnamese refugees that was going largely unchecked because the police were unfamiliar with their language and culture.  Paper Largest of Three  ''You Americans, you take your free press, free thought for granted,'' said Pauline Van Tho, head of a Vietnamese resettlement program here. ''When we first came here, we did too. But now, we start to wonder.''  Mr. Thong, a 30-year career journalist fled with his family from Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City, and came to this country in 1975. He started the newspaper, Tu Do, which means freedom, in August 1981 and rapidly turned it into the largest of the three Vietnameselanguage newspapers in Houston. Readers described it as a generalinterest newspaper that tended to be a bit sensational.  ''There was a lot of controversial stuff in there,'' Mrs. Van Tho said. ''Maybe too much.'' The articles dealt with a wide range of topics affecting the Vietnamese here, including Ku Klux Klan activities against Vietnamese fishermen off the Texas coast. But the articles that seemed to cause the greatest notice were Mr. Thong's campaign against local money-raising groups that he deemed insincere in their support of anti-Communist leaders in Vietnam and against refugee resettlement programs that he said were fraudulent.  Angry Calls Turned to Threats  In his last issue, for example, Mr. Thong published a front-page article on an anti-Communist Vietnamese group here that said it was headed by a military hero in Vietnam. In the article, Mr. Thong said that the man was not associated with the group. On another occasion, Mr. Thong said that a businessman, asserting that he was supported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had duped refugees here into paying him as much as $20,000 to reunite them with their families abroad, a task the businessman was not able to fulfill.  Mr. Thong's wife, Hoa, said that as late as three days before his death her husband received an anonymous call from someone threatening to kill him if he continued his newspaper. She said that another call was made the day after he died and that the threats had continued since then.  ''I wanted to keep the paper going,'' Mrs. Thong said. ''But with these threats, how can I? I feel guilty I cannot follow the spirit of his work, but I just can't now.''  The killing here occurred 13 months after Lam Trong Duong, editor of a community newsletter in San Francisco, was shot to death on a busy street there. And last January in Los Angeles, Bong Huu Bach, the publisher of a small newspaper, was shot at but not hit as he left a restaurant.

"      Eleven children of mixed American and Vietnamese background are scheduled to leave Ho Chi Minh City on Thursday for the United States, State Department officials said today.  The children, all United States citizens, the offspring of American soldiers serving in Vietnam during the war, are the first substantial group of Amerasians to leave Vietnam in years. Their scheduled departure, under the auspices of the Pearl Buck Foundation and other groups, has stirred hopes among relief officials that Vietnam will soon open the way for the release of other children of mixed parentage.  Although figures vary, the number of Amerasian children in Vietnam may range from 8,000 to 20,000. Many of the children of the Americans are abandoned and objects of scorn in Vietnam because of their mixed parentage.  U.N. Arranged Their Exit  The 11 children, who will be accompanied by about a dozen relatives, are scheduled to be met by a United States official at the Ho Chi Minh City airport, processed quickly and then placed on a plane to Bangkok, Thailand, where they will stay for several days before arriving in the United States. The United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Vietnam, and the arrangements for the children were made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  State Department officials said that ''documentation exists'' for 80 to 85 Amerasian children who are United States citizens and whose relatives, mostly fathers, are awaiting their arrival. In most of the cases the children's parents were married in Vietnam and the fathers applied for United States citizenship for their offspring. In several cases, a State Department official said, the children may have been born in the United States and then been taken to Vietnam by their Vietnamese mothers.  The expected departure of the group on Thursday is the first substantial group of Amerasians to leave Vietnam legally since 1978, when 29 wives and children of Americans were allowed to leave under the auspices of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachussetts.  Besides the Pearl Buck Foundation, other groups who will accompany the children to Bangkok, and then the United States, are Church World Services, American for International Aid, Holt International Children's Services, American Council of Voluntary Agencies in Foreign Service, the American Friends Service Committee and Operation California.  'Desire for Normalized Relations'  ''The significance of this, I believe, is that the Vietnamese are making yet another sign of their desire for normalized relations with the United States,'' said Richard Walden, executive director of Operation California, a privately supported group that has distributed aid to refugees Vietnam, Cambodia and elsewhere.  But some State Department officials maintained that the Vietnamese Government, despite public statements by Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, has failed to respond to American requests to start processing the documents of many of the children. There may be as many as 2,000 ''documented'' cases of Amerasian children, or youngsters who have been able to prove that they have a parent in the United States, officials said.

"      Ten years ago today, Henry A. Kissinger and Le Duc Tho met in a French Communist Party villa in Gif-sur-Yvette, a Parisian suburb, to initial the ''Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam.'' Four days later, the Secretary of State and the Foreign Ministers of North Vietnam and South Vietnam signed the document at a ceremony in Paris, and on March 27, 1973, the last uniformed American soldier left Vietnamese territory, ending more than a decade of direct American military involvement there.  Today's anniversary is an ironic and tragic occasion because Vietnam is still at war, though this time against other enemies, and because it has become little more than a pawn in the Soviet-Chinese rivalry in Asia. Moreover, Vietnam has become a Soviet client state rather than the fully independent nation it had hoped to be when Ho Chi Minh rose to overthrow French rule in 1945, and an internationally isolated country with abysmally low living standards.  The question arising at this time is why the 55 million Vietnamese find themselves in such an extraordinary external and internal predicament, with millions forceably removed to ''new economic zones'' and other millions officially listed as ''enemies,'' when the Communist regime ruling them was supposedly the victor in what amounted to a 30-year war.  Much of the disaster, as it has unfolded over the last 10 years, may be attributed to Vietnam's wartime exhaustion, its shattered infrastructure - both North and South - and the dogmatic attitudes of the aging ideologues in power in Hanoi.  Still, it remains a valid and fascinating question whether all the events since 1973 were, in effect, foreordained by history, or whether they might have been averted or at least altered, had Vietnamese as well as United States policies moved in wiser directions. I believe a case can be --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tad Szulc is author ''Illusion of Peace,'' a study of United States foreign policy in the Nixon years.  made for the proposition that a diplomatic and economic relationship might have evolved that offered Vietnam alternatives other than the Soviet alliance and internal calamity.  Today, to be sure, Vietnam's significance to the United States lies mainly in its being the site of a major Soviet naval and air base - Cam Ranh Bay - that poses a potential threat to American strategic positions in Asia and the Indian Ocean, but this is still a secondary concern in the Pentagon's global preoccupation.  The ultimate Communist vicotyr in Vietnam in 1975 hasn't produced the ''domino effect'' in Southeast Asia that had been feared: Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, are not seriously imperiled. And Hanoi's entrapment in the endless war of its own making in Cambodia and Laos, pious propaganda notwithstanding, is not wholly unwelcomed in Washington inasmuch as it is deeply damaging to all the Communist players in the region.  In a way that could not be foreseen in Paris in 1973, it is Vietnam that seems, 10 years later, to be the principal victim of that conflict. China has not fared particularly well either, having lost most of its influence in Southeast Asia. And considering America's immense investment - human and material - and the profound societal consequences, it too suffered badly from this unnecessary war; yet its fundamental long-range interests were not catastrophically affected.  If the war produced a winner, politically and strategically, it was clearly the Soviet Union - albeit at a great continuing cost - because the conflict's consequences neutralized China in Southeast Asia and permitted the Soviet Union to acquire military bases both in Vietnam and Cambodia.  But looking back to the peace agreement and its aftermath, it seems evident that the document provided the only way of taking the United States out of a war that was no longer politically tenable at home. While the Nixon Administration had armed the regime in Saigon to the teeth in the months preceding the final American withdrawal (and sought to weaken the North through the Christmas 1972 mass bombings), in retrospect it is clear that a Communist victory was inevitable if Hanoi wanted it. At the moment of the cease-fire, the overall military situation on the ground favored the Communists.  Yet, there may have been lost opportunities on both sides - American and North Vietnamese - for history to develop differently. First, President Nixon promised, in a secret letter to the North Vietnamese Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong, $ 4.75 billion in reconstruction funds, and agreed to a United States-North Vietnamese Joint Economic Commission. An economic accord was to be signed on July 23, 1973. What happened next is unclear. Though the chief American negotiator had reported on March 27, 1973, the day the last American soldier left Vietnam, that the aid pact was virtually ready, he was instructed the following week to break off the talks. The official explanation was that Mr. Nixon had decided to cancel the aid because Hanoi was infiltrating new military equipment into South Vietnam, violating the cease-fire, and because it went on fighting in Cambodia. Yet, Saigon was equally guilty of cease-fire violations, and American B-52's had resumed the bombing of Cambodia. (Under the Paris agreement, the cease-fire did not apply to Cambodia.)  What we do not know is whether Hanoi had resolved to sacrifice American aid for tactical advantage or whether Mr. Nixon deliberately overreacted to the violations because of opposition at home to reconstruction aid. Likewise, one wonders whether Hanoi would have launched the victorious 1975 offensive if it had been receiving American assistance. The inner workings of the Hanoi leadership have always been a mystery.  Between 1975 and 1978, new opportunities developed. For more than two years, Vietnam had resisted Soviet demands for military facilities at Cam Ranh Bay and Danang, seemingly keen on maximum independence, while sending signals to Washington that it wished to normalize relations. By 1977, the Carter Administration responded favorably. Curiously, however, Hanoi wanted American aid as ''reparations,'' an unacceptable notion. Hanoi abandoned that idea in 1978, but by then it was too late: Congress already had forbidden all aid to Vietnam, and Jimmy Carter was moving ahead toward normalization with Peking, now hostile to Hanoi.  Late in 1978, Vietnam joined Comecon, the Communist common market, and signed a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union.  Then it invaded Cambodia to overthrow the bloody, China-backed Pol Pot regime, and installed Heng Samrin as its puppet. Early in 1979, Vietnam granted the bases to the Soviet Union, greatly facilitating its naval operations between the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. In February, China attacked Vietnam in an inconclusive border war.  Vietnam's destiny as a Soviet ally was sealed.  The consequences for Vietnam have been awesome. The Cambodian war, now in its fifth year, is tying down 200,000 Vietnamese troops unable to defeat local guerrillas (and there are 60,000 troops in Laos fighting Hmong tribesmen). Economically, Vietnam is barely surviving despite $ 2 billion annually in Soviet aid. Per capita income fell from $ 241 in 1976 to $ 153 in 1981. Millions of Vietnamese have fled the country; a half-million are working in the Soviet Union. The septuagenarian Hanoi leadership is frozen in immobility, unable to cope with its problems.  This is Vietnam 10 years after the ""peace"" of Paris.

"      Mary Rose of Birmingham, Ala., still wakes up in the middle of the night and imagines that her son, Capt. Scott Ketchie, is alive in a prison camp in Vietnam.  ''He was a navigator on an A-6, shot down in 1972 over the Ho Chi Minh trail,'' Mrs. Rose, who is no longer married to Scott's father, said quietly. ''The pilot was rescued, parachuted out of the plane with Scott. But Scott was never found.'' She shrugged. ''Death is final, I could live with that, but Scott was my only child and, well, I guess I'll wait and hope forever.''  In the corner of a crowded lobby in the Hyatt Regency Crystal City Hotel, Patricia Maves of Portland, Ore., stood with her 11-year-old daughter, Camille. The girl was only 8 months old when her father, Capt. Richard A. Brett, was shot down over Laos while serving as a pilot on an F-111.  ''It's living with the uncertainty that's so hard,'' said Mrs.  Maves, who remarried recently. ''I think there's a possibility that some men may be alive somewhere, but not Richard. The uncertainty became too much for me and I guess I just decided that Richard had died.''  Kept Asking for Her Father  She said slowly, ''When Camille was 3 or 4 she kept asking for her father and I told her he was probably killed but nobody really knows and she said she was going to find him. Well that just tore me up. It brought up a lot of pain.''  The two women were among more than 500 relatives of Americans still listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia who gathered today for the start of a two-day meeting to mark the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Paris peace accords that ended United States participation in the war in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The meeting today was marked by a speech by William P. Clark, President Reagan's national security adviser, and an updating of reports on the fate of the missing given by officials of the sponsoring organization, the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.  The Air Force flew many of the relatives to Washington from 19 bases around the country and will fly them home Saturday without charge.  The mood of the wives and children and parents of the missing was often anguished. ''I doubt seriously that my husband is alive,'' said Susan Miller of Corpus Christi, Tex., whose husband, Curtis, an Air Force major, was shot down in an AC-130 over Laos in 1972. ''I would just like to see him back in Texas soil.''  Reports Treated Warily  Although officials of the organization insist that ''eyewitness reports'' and ''sightings'' by refugees indicate that some men are alive - and that the Vietnamese are withholding the remains of more than 400 Americans - Reagan Administration officials speak warily of reports about American prisoners still being alive in Southeast Asia.  Maj. Bob Shields, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the Department of Defense ''operates on the assumption that some could be alive.'' He added: ''We don't have evidence that there are some alive, we don't have evidence that there aren't. But we have to press on as if some were alive.''  Mr. Clark, in his speech today, said, ''Information now in our possession disallows us from ruling out the possibiity that Americans are still being detained against their will.'' Mr. Clark noted that President Reagan would speak to the group on Friday, a decision that buoyed many of the families who assert that the Reagan Administration has shown far more interest in the issue than did the Carter and Ford Administrations.  ''We not only care deeply about our missing men and you, their families, but we are devoting our highest priority resources to the task of obtaining the release of any prisoners who may still be held, the fullest possible accounting of those missing, and the repatriation of remains of those who died serving our nation,'' said Mr. Clark.  Warning From Several Speakers  Vietnamese officials, including Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, have insisted that the Hanoi Government has retained neither American prisoners nor American remains, and that a substantial number of those listed as missing appear to have disappeared in jungle areas difficult to reach.  At meetings today, several speakers, including Mr. Clark, warned families against providing money - as some apparently had - to groups or mercenaries who said that they had seen American prisoners alive in Vietnam and were planning to rescue them in what the national security adviser termed ''private cross-border forays.''  ''Our experience is that such private groups operate under faulty intelligence,'' said Mr. Clark, who added that unscrupulous people sometimes take advantage of bereaved families.  After the speech and through the afternoon, many of the families drove to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial across the Potomac to examine the names of their fathers and sons. Kay Marker of San Antonio was planning to visit the memorial with her two children, Jeff and Suzanne, who were 3 years old and 15 months old when their father, Michael, an Army captain, was shot down in a reconnaissance aircraft in the demilitarized zone in March 1971.  ''He's not alive, I'm sure of that,'' said Mrs. Marker softly.  ''The children didn't even know their father. We just want him back, we want his body back.''  50 Amerasians Leave Vietnam  HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Jan. 27 (AP) - Fifty Amerasian children and their relatives left Vietnam en route to the United States today.

"      President Reagan today told families of American servicemen still missing in Southeast Asia that United States intelligence agencies were ''fully focused'' on the problem and that the goal of a full accounting was ''the highest national priority.''  ''The anguish you've suffered - the families of brave men listed as prisoners of war or as missing in action - is unspeakable, something the rest of us can never really know even in partial measure,'' Mr. Reagan said in an emotional meeting with more than 500 relatives, including wives, children and parents, of the missing Americans.  Appearing at a meeting of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, Mr. Reagan stood in front of the bleak black flag of the organization and received a standing ovation when he said: ''Your vigil is over. Your Government is attentive and the intelligence assets of the United States are fully focused on this issue.''  Mr. Reagan's appearance at the meeting in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Crystal City, Virginia, near Washington, and the tone of his comments underlined his strong involvement since the late 1960's in the issue of Americans missing in action in Southeast Asia.  Mr. Reagan said that the ''full resources'' of the Government were committed to the goal of a full accounting of the 2,494 Americans who remained unaccounted for after the Vietnam War.

"    To the Editor:  Tad Szulc's Jan. 23 Op-Ed article on Vietnam is, in the opinion of one who has just completed his 16th trip to Vietnam within three years, both dead accurate as to America's many lost opportunities for a productive U.S.-Vietnamese rapprochement and inaccurate in a number of instances regarding current conditions.  Dwelling on the inaccuracies in Szulc's commentary:  * While many thousands (not millions) of Vietnamese were indeed sent to New Economic Zones in an unsuccessful experiment to improve agricultural production, many, if not most, of these people have now returned to their urban homes without penalty.  * Hanoi's ''war of its own making'' in Cambodia was in fact an understandable (if not justifiable) reaction to repeated military attacks on its territory by the murderous Pol Pot regime and Hanoi's having to house 300,000 refugees from Cambodia and Vietnam at great cost.  * China has indeed fared very well in Southeast Asia, despite Szulc's claim to the contrary: 300,000 Vietnamese troops are tied down defending their country's northern frontier; 200,000 troops are making little headway against not a local but a Chinese-armed insurgency in Cambodia, and Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and Singapore are far more responsive to China's wishes than they are to U.S. policy initiatives.  * As for the Soviet ''win'' in Indochina, what kind of victory is it when the Soviets have to spend $2 billion a year supporting two governments whose own functionaries criticize every aspect of their presence and dwell repeatedly on their preference for U.S. aid to that of a demanding, clumsy ally?  America should not waste a great opportunity in Indochina. It is there for the asking. RICHARD M.

"    To the Editor:  I do not wish to detract from Tad Szulc's thoughtful article about Vietnam (Op-Ed Jan. 23), but there are a few points of fact and one of interpretation that beg for comment:  It was the Americans, not the Vietnamese, who insisted on calling possible postwar assistance ''reparations.'' The Vietnamese were careful to use the vocabulary of the Paris peace agreement, which called for help in ''healing the wounds of war.''  The Vietnamese miscalculation was in continuing to hope for at least some aid as part of the package, until too late in the negotiations. By the time they yielded that point, the United States had already decided to put relations with China on the fast track and derail talks with Vietnam.  * The most recent Western estimates put Vietnamese troop strength in Cambodia at 140,000 to 150,000, still a serious drain on the Vietnamese economy but some reduction (180,000 was generally quoted a year ago).  * That half a million Vietnamese are working in the Soviet Union is certainly an overstatement. Reports from Bangkok, including one in the Aug. 3, 1982, Christian Science Monitor, give more weight to official figures from Vietnam and the Soviet Union, which put about 11,000 Vietnamese workers and students in the Soviet Union - part of some 50,000 in the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe combined. The same article notes that these jobs are considered plums - no surprise considering that pay in the Soviet bloc is many times higher than that in Vietnam.  * If Mr. Szulc had followed internal developments in Vietnam over the past two or three years a bit more closely, I believe he would agree that the country's leaders are not ''frozen in immobility.''  There has been a remarkable thaw in their views on economic policy. They have been experimenting with material incentives in agriculture and industry, and this has already improved the country's food supply.  They have been listening to policy recommendations even from some of the Old Saigon political figures, such as Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a onetime Saigon Government minister and former I.M.F. official.  Whether any new policies the leadership follows will be enough to pull Vietnam out of the economic quicksand remains to be seen.

"      The Reagan Administration has become concerned that privately organized expeditions into Indochina in search of missing United States servicemen may upset delicate talks with Laos and Vietnam on efforts to recover more remains of Americans lost during the Vietnam War.  At least one armed expeditionary force, headed by a former United States Special Forces officer, entered Laos in recent months in search of Americans rumored still to be alive and held captive. The foray was unsuccessful and has been denounced by Laos, as well as Thailand, the country from which the expedition was mounted.  United States officials say that other forays have taken place and that they periodically receive rumors that still more expeditions are being planned. Families of missing men report having been asked, off and on, to give money for private expeditions and intelligencegathering activities.  Some 2,500 Americans are still missing from the war. American officials believe that most, if not all, are dead. United States combat involvement in the region ended in 1973.  Possibility Not Ruled Out  But the possibility that some of the men might still be alive and in prison, as refugees from Southeast Asia periodically report, has never been totally ruled out. In fact, several years ago, when negotiations with the Laotians and Vietnamese were getting nowhere, the United States Government reportedly sponsored its own search expedition. It returned empty-handed.  Since then, the negotiations have been more productive, according to American officials. The Laotians and Vietnamese have denied that any prisoners are still being held, but delegations from the United States have been received by both countries and the remains of a number of men have been returned.  The United States has no diplomatic relations with either Laos or Vietnam.  ''We have been making some progress and so these private raids are counterproductive,'' a White House official said after learning of the recent incursion into Laos. ''We've been encouraged up to now by what we've been hearing from the Laotians and, to a lesser extent, from the Vietnamese. We don't want to lose this headway. It's a delicate situation.''  One of the main goals of the negotiations with the Laotians is to win permission for American recovery experts to accompany Laotian officials on visits to several hundred sites where United States planes are known to have crashed during the war. About a fourth of the Americans still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia were lost in Laos.  Last week, during a convention of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, President Reagan said the United States Government had placed the ''highest national priority'' on obtaining a full accounting. His remarks were enthusiastically received by league members, some of whom had questioned the commitment of previous Presidents and had contributed money to private search efforts.  The league also heard from William P. Clark, the President's assistant for national security affairs, who said the Reagan Administration was ''resolutely opposed'' to private across-theborder forays. ''Such actions,'' he said, ''interfere with and damage legitimate efforts on a number of fronts. Our experience has been that such private initiatives operate with faulty or fabricated intelligence and lack even marginally adquate operational capabilities.''  The latest expedition into Laos took place in late November and involved several Americans and about a dozen sympathetic Laotian guerrillas. The group, reportedly led by James G. Gritz of Los Angeles, a former lieutenant colonel in the Special Forces and a Vietnam War veteran, went in search of 120 Americans who refugees had said were being held in prison.  Shortly after crossing into Laos from Thailand, the group was fired upon. It suffered casualties and withdrew.

"    ANGELES, Feb. 10   On the sun-dappled campus of the University of Southern California, the Vietnam War issue was refought this week at an academic conference with some of the anger and confusion that surrounded the war itself.  The four-day meeting on the lessons of Vietnam was supposed to be a dispassionate analysis of the war, 10 years after the signing of the Paris peace accords and the withdrawal of the last American combat forces, in January 1973.  The 65 participants included some of the best-known Vietnam journalists and antiwar activists, with a sprinking of former generals and Government officials. Among them were Frances FitzGerald, author of the best-selling ''Fire in the Lake,'' and Daniel Ellsberg, who says he gave the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times.  But instead the conference was often emotional and acrimonious, and the main lesson that emerged was that ''Vietnam is not over,'' in the words of Daniel K. Wagoner, a former Army Ranger who served in Vietnam in 1969.  'Will Never Be Over'  ''Vietnam will never be over,'' said Mr. Wagoner, who was angry that as a veteran he had to pay to attend the conference and so, with a group of other veterans, used his Ranger training to crash a dinner for the participants. ''Rangers don't die, they recon the valley of death,'' Mr. Wagoner said in the macabre argot of Vietnam.  The meetings, which were held in a densely packed campus theater and which ended last night, provided a forum for people to bear witness to the wounds and divisiveness of the war.  Journalists clashed with one another over how accurate their reporting of the war was. A former general contended that Washington had hamstrung the military by not giving it enough troops or authority to cut off North Vietnamese sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia. Three former agents of the Central Intelligence Agency said they knew how the agency planted false information with well-known journalists to mislead American opinion about the war.  Vietnamese refugees shouted at former antiwar activists sympathetic to Hanoi and asked why they did not show as much concern for the hundreds of thousands of people incarcerated by the Communists after the war and for the plight of the boat people.  Above all, dozens of Vietnam veterans, some in worn Army field jackets and others in three-piece business suits, berated the Government, the press and the American public for ignoring them.  'Too Late to Punish Anybody'  ''It's too late to punish anybody for what happened, but we have got to make the Government do something to help these people,'' Nicholas Road, a former paratrooper with the 101st Airborne Division, said after a panel discussion on veterans' problems. ''I'm still trying to catch about 10 years of my life that I lost after my 19th birthday.''  Long lines formed after each panel discussion as members of the audience took over the microphone and delivered their own speeches, delaying some sessions till midnight.  ''For the past three days I've listened to some of the most selfrighteous S.O.B.'s tell us about how they reported the war,'' said another veteran, Rick Berg. ''We've been trying to talk for years. But they've been talking for us. What is this?''  Among the scheduled speakers were David Halberstam, a former New York Times correspondent in Vietnam and author of ''The Best and the Brightest''; Harrison Salisbury, a former Times editor who was among the first reporters to visit Hanoi in the war; Peter Arnett, who won two Pulitzer Prizes while reporting on Vietnam for The Associated Press, and Morley Safer of CBS News.  Some Quiet Insights  Amid the hostility and the hisses, there were also some quiet insights and reflective questions.  William Shawcross, a writer for The Sunday Times of London and author of ''Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia,'' wondered how the Communist Government of Vietnam had gone so astray after the war. He noted that given the damage and dislocations of the war, any government would have had trouble in Vietnam after 1975.  But why, he asked, does Vietnam maintain the third largest army in the world, bigger even than that of the United States, devoting 46 percent of its national budget to the military? Why does Vietnam have 200,000 troops occupying Cambodia and 40,000 more in Laos? Why did the North Vietnamese after the war ignore the leaders of the National Liberation Front, the Vietcong, in the South.  John McAuliff, director of the Indochina program of the American Friends Service Committee, contended that while most Americans blamed Hanoi for Vietnam's postwar plight, the fault ''lies at least as much in Washington.'' He said that if Washington had lived up to the terms of the Paris peace agreement and provided postwar aid to Vietnam, the situation would be different.  Mr. McAuliff even suggested that American hostility toward Hanoi after the war might have contributed to the Communists' policy of imprisoning large numbers of former South Vietnamese soldiers and officials in ''re-education'' camps.  Recognition of Hanoi Urged  Washington should recognize Hanoi now to end what he called ''the third Indochina war'' and stop opposing Vietnamese nationalism.  But Douglas Pike, a retired Foreign Service officer who teaches about Vietnam at the University of California at Berkeley, charged that Vietnam's postwar troubles were attributable to the age, isolation and dogmatism of Vietnam's Communist Party Politburo.  Mr. Shawcross pointed out that, with the complexity of American ties with China and the nations of Southeast Asia, Hanoi would have to make some concession on its occupation of Cambodia for the United States to normalize relations with Vietnam now.  One of the most poignant moments of the conference came when Tran Quang Thuan, a former South Vietnamese senator and Buddhist activist, questioned Nguyen Ngoc Dung, Hanoi's deputy representative to the United Nations, about why several leading Buddhist monks had been imprisoned by the Communists.  Mrs. Dung, speaking by a radio hookup from New York, insisted that Hanoi allowed freedom of religion and that ''if they are in jail, it is because they are criminals.'' She called the question slanderous.  New Political Prisoners Cited  Don Luce, an antiwar writer who had focused attention on the plight of political prisoners held by the South Vietnamese regime of Nguyen Van Thieu, was challenged over his silence on the condition of political prisoners held by the Communists today.  Ginetta Sagan, a founder of Amnesty International in California who used to keep records of prisoners held by the Thieu Government, said to Mr. Luce, ''Unless we speak up, we are going to lose our credibility as defenders of human rights.'' Miss Sagan said she had become concerned about the Communists' detention of political prisoners after some leftist Vietnamese who had furnished her with information about prisoners during the war were themselves arrested after 1975.  On how America got involved in Vietnam, James C. Thomson, a member of National Security Council staff under President Johnson, suggested that beyond the factors usually cited, such as a belief in the need to contain Communism, there was a ''missionary impulse,'' the ''need to go good to others.'' After the Communist victory in China in 1949, this missionary zeal was transferred from China to Indochina, Mr. Thomson suggested, making for a brand of ''sentimental imperialism.''

"    Ten years ago today, I stood on the floodlit tarmac of Tan Son Nhut air base and watched as a group of 27 American prisoners of war were delivered to freedom by United States Army helicopters. The men had been picked up from a Communistcontrolled rubber plantation near the Cambodian border, and their arrival was the first tangible benefit for Americans of the Paris peace accords, signed in late January.  It was an emotional moment. Gen. Frederick C. Weyand, the last commander of United States forces in Vietnam, draped his arm around an Air Force colleague and confided, in tones just loud enough for me to hear, ''It's the greatest day we've ever had in Vietnam.''  There was a kind of resignation and finality about the remark, like a losing football team salvaging a share of its pride with a meaningless touchdown in the final moments of the game. So it was with Vietnam. With the signing of the Paris agreement and the return of our P.O.W.'s, we withdrew not only the last American combat forces from Vietnam, but also our slender remaining interest in the country.  The war itself, of course, sputtered on for another two years, until Saigon's stunning collapse in April 1975. But Americans went into a trance of collective amnesia. The Vietnam War was such an agonizing, divisive and baffling experience that we somehow resolved simply to forget it. Unlike the fall of Nationalist China to Mao Zedong in 1949, there were no postwar recriminations, no blame for who lost Vietnam. The shock had been so great that nobody wanted to know. As a result, Vietnam became not only the longest war in our history and the first war the United States had lost - it was also the most misunderstood war.  The big questions went unasked and unanswered: How did we get involved in Vietnam? Why did 57,939 Americans die there? Why did the Communists win? What were the lessons of the war?  But now, a decade after the last American troops left Saigon, Vietnam is sparking renewed interest - though without the explosive rancor of the 1960's and early 70's. The hottest star on television is Tom Selleck, who plays Magnum, an amiable private eye and Vietnam veteran whose exploits often involve flashbacks to his combat days in ''Nam.'' Public Television is planning an ambitious 13-hour series on the war, which it will show within a year. The dedication of the polished black granite Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington last November finally gave Vietnam veterans a respected if ambiguous place alongside the monuments to Jefferson, Lincoln and Washington.  Ultimately, the most important development may be the emergence of a small group of scholars, journalists and military specialists who have started to look afresh at the war. Drawing on new disclosures from Hanoi, the opening of documents in the Presidential libraries, the Pentagon Papers (which are still the best published source material on the war) and memoirs of some of the participants in the war, these writers have worked quietly, with the general public largely unaware of their research. For most of these scholars, their re-examination is not to prove whether Vietnam was or was not a ''noble cause,'' in President Reagan's phrase, but to find out what really happened and why. In the process, they are challenging some of the most cherished beliefs of both the right and the left.  Among the new findings are the following: As opposed to the public caricature of him as a warmonger, Lyndon Johnson was actually reluctant to become more deeply involved in Vietnam. He sent American troops to Vietnam not out of machismo, but out of fear that if he ''lost'' South Vietnam, Congress would not pass his Great Society programs.  Contrary to the American popular assumption that we could easily win, American Presidents from John Kennedy to Richard Nixon were never confident about our chances and, in fact, never had a plan to win in Vietnam. Instead, they did only the minimum necessary not to lose Vietnam during their own tenure in the White House. They tried to fight a war on the cheap against a foe, North Vietnam, whose commitment was total. Under the restrictions imposed by the Presidents, some American generals knew almost from the start that they could not win the war. Without permission to cut off Hanoi's use of Laos and Cambodia, they realized, the critical strategic initiative remained in Hanoi's hands. Many officers now believe the Joint Chiefs of Staff should have resigned in protest. Both hawks and liberals were wrong about the Communists in Vietnam. While successive Administrations did not understand that the Communists' appeal had its roots in centuries of Vietnamese xenophobia, many antiwar critics - like Frances FitzGerald in her bestselling ''Fire in the Lake'' - over-glamorized the Vietcong, the Southern insurgents, and underestimated the role that North Vietnam played in leading the war in the South. The 1968 Tet offensive was a disastrous military defeat for the Communists, as Gen. William C. Westmoreland claimed, though most Americans regarded it as a setback for the United States. It was particularly brutal for the Vietcong, who bore the brunt of the fighting and who suffered such losses that thereafter they had to be replaced by North Vietnamese regulars, turning the conflict into a war between North and South.  After Tet - though most Americans at home had given up on the war -the cumulative weight of American firepower and spending in Vietnam dramatically undercut support for the Communists. As a result, the United States was probably in a stronger position in Vietnam in 1972, just before the Paris peace accords, than at any previous point in the war. The antiwar movement did not have as much impact on American policy as is popularly thought. Lyndon Johnson's decision in March 1968 to de-escalate the war was not so much a response to the peace movement as a result of disaffection within his Administration over the disastrous costs of the war. The protesters' main contribution, in fact, may have been to help elect Richard Nixon twice - in 1968 over Hubert Humphrey and in 1972 over George McGovern.  A NEW GENERATION DECRIES SCHOLARLY ARROGANCE  The picture of the Vietnam conflict that is emerging from the new research shows a war that was more complex, more morally ambiguous, than either the doves or the hawks had maintained. Of the war's many ironical twists, few match the postwar predicament of Communist Vietnam.  ''It was a war nobody won,'' says Stanley Karnow, a syndicated columnist, who covered Vietnam for several national publications. ''North Vietnam won, of course, but it also lost.'' Mr. Karnow - who is chief correspondent for Public Television's series on Vietnam and who is writing a book to accompany it - was in Hanoi in 1981 to film some interviews for the series. He remembers asking Prime Minister Pham Van Dong what Vietnam's main problem now is. ''He laughed,'' recalls Mr. Karnow. '' 'That's a stupid question. Look around, you can see for yourself what problems we're having.' ''  Hanoi's grim postwar record has raised a serious problem for scholars. How much should it be taken into account when the war is analyzed? Can events during the war be interpreted in the light of the Communists' postwar detention of 50,000 to 100,000 former supporters of the Saigon regime in ''re-education'' camps, the corruption and economic mismanagement by Communist officials, the invasion of Cambodia, the persecution of Vietnam's large Chinese ethnic minority and the flight of the boat people?  David W.P. Elliott, an assistant professor of political science at Pomona College in California, believes that Vietnam's postwar record is irrelevant to understanding the war. ''We shouldn't commit the historicist fallacy of reading the present into the past,'' says Mr. Elliott. ''In 1975, the people wanted peace.'' Like many of the new scholars, Mr. Elliott's interest in Vietnam goes back to the 1960's. He learned Vietnamese in the Army and later did research on the Vietcong for the Rand Corporation, a private research organization working mostly for the Defense Department.  One of the few Vietnamese now teaching in the United States, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, an assistant professor of history at Harvard, agrees that the Communists' postwar failures ''do not vindicate America's crusade in Vietnam.'' For a part of Vietnam's troubles today were caused by the dislocations of the war. But Mrs. Tai, who came to the United States as a student at Brandeis, maintains that what has happened since 1975 offers an important perspective.  ''During the war,'' she says, ''people looked at the Communists and said they were dedicated, driven and omnicompetent. Now we see them as corrupt and incompetent.'' Did the Communists change so much after 1975 or were Americans grossly mistaken in their earlier impressions?  Mrs. Tai believes that many Americans allowed their political passions to cloud their intellect. At the time of the war, she says, ''it was fashionable to think that a guerrilla movement needed popular support to succeed, and that if the Vietcong survived, therefore they must have popular support.'' But that, Mrs. Tai contends, was a fallacious argument. ''You can see how wrong it was now, because the Communists certainly aren't popular in the South.'' Or, she suggests, look at Cambodia. ''Pol Pot came to power as a guerrilla, but looking at what he did to his country, you'd think twice before saying he was popular.''  Mrs. Tai herself cannot be accused of being an inveterate anti-Communist. Her father was a founder of the Trotskyite party in Vietnam; an aunt was a senior official in the Vietcong's Provisional Revolutionary Government. But she has long had reservations about those antiwar protesters who were too ready to turn the Vietnamese Communists into paragons of virtue and who refused to accept a view of the war that was not black and white.  At Brandeis, she remembers, a professor asked her in class what the Vietnamese thought of the war. When she said that it was a difficult question to answer, since the view of an intellectual was probably very different from that of a peasant, the professor became angry. ''Later,'' she says, ''a student told me that my views didn't count because I was a bourgeois. I said, 'I'm sorry; I'm a human being. There are several hundred thousand members of the middle class in Vietnam.'  ''  This kind of academic narrow-mindedness, in Mrs. Tai's view, contributed to American misunderstanding of Vietnam just as much as ignorance in the White House and the State Department.  Until quite recently, Vietnam has been a giant black hole in American academia. A survey byin 1970 found that there was no scholar in the United States who devoted most of his or her time to studying North Vietnam; there was no American university with a tenured professorship in Vietnamese studies, and there were fewer than 30 students in the country studying the Vietnamese language. By comparison, there were three times that many studying Thai. According to the Social Science Research Council in New York, from 1951 to 1981 a total of 820 Americans applied to it for financial aid to work on Ph.D. dissertations in Southeast Asia. Of these, only 33 were for Vietnam, almost the same number as for Burma.  John K. Fairbank, professor emeritus of history at Harvard and the man generally recognized as the founder of modern Chinese studies in the United States, refers to this lack of expertise on Vietnam as an academic Pearl Harbor. One reason for this blind spot, he suggests, was that the French excluded American missionaries and businessmen from Vietnam, and Americans therefore did not have a personal stake in Vietnam.  However, by the time the United States became militarily involved, many academics considered the war so immoral that dispassionate analysis of the conflict became almost impossible. Only a handful of scholars actually went to Vietnam to do research there.  One of them was Samuel L. Popkin, now an associate professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego. After he spent time in 1966 conducting interviews in Vietnamese villages, he was treated as a pariah when he returned to Harvard, where he was then an assistant professor.  His problem: He had returned from Vietnam with a complex view. He did not approve of the way the Americans were fighting the war - ''this crazy chasing around in the villages with our massive firepower looking for body counts'' - but he did not find that the Communists were the popular good guys of American antiwar mythology.  Mr. Popkin's friends in Cambridge didn't want to hear about this. He got back in his colleagues' good graces only after he was jailed in 1972 for refusing to testify before a special grand jury set up by the White House to find out who leaked the Pentagon Papers - the Pentagon's massive top-secret study of American involvement in Indochina from World War II to May 1968 - to The New York Times.  Douglas Pike, who throughout the war years was the resident expert in the United States Embassy in Saigon on the Vietnamese Communists, remembers a similar encounter with academic close-mindedness when he was on leave in Cambridge, Mass., in 1964 to write a book about the Vietcong. He had been invited to take part in an antiwar teach-in and found himself debating with a professor from the Harvard Dental School. ''The professor really didn't have his facts straight, so I asked him if he had ever been to Vietnam,'' Mr. Pike recalls.  '' 'No, that's not necessary,' the professor replied. ''So I said, 'I've never been to dental school, but suppose I give you a root canal.' '' 'That's different,' he said. ''I replied, 'How at Harvard, of all places, can you say knowledge is not important?' '' Mr. Pike has now retired from the Government and is the first director of the Indochina studies program at the University of California at Berkeley -an appointment that would have been unthinkable a decade ago at a campus that was in the vanguard of the antiwar movement. Mr. Pike has just completed a book on the North Vietnamese Army, which he wrote after discovering to his amazement that there was no comparable study. ''We never even knew the names of North Vietnam's generals or what their strategic thinking was,'' he says. ''It shows how ignorant and arrogant we were. We just assumed we would win.'' Mr. Pike's presence at Berkeley, where he is setting up a two-million-page archive on Indochina, is testament to Vietnam's having quietly made the transition from controversial public issue to history. Was victory by the Communists inevitable? Since the end of the war, some of the best new scholarship has focused on the origins of the Communist movement in Vietnam and its reasons for success. According to one school of thought, the Communists' early capture of the nationalist issue made their eventual victory a foregone conclusion. David G. Marr - a visiting professor at Cornell last fall who is now teaching at the Australian National University in Canberra - has shown how the Communists under Ho Chi Minh were able to build their strength in the 1930's and 40's by appealing to the centuriesold tradition of Vietnamese nationalism. Mr. Marr's two books, ''Vietnamese Anti-Colonialism, 1885-1925'' (1971) and ''Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920-1945'' (1981), are widely regarded as models of scholarly research.  In his view, ''the most important development of the entire conflict was the August 1945 revolution,'' when the Vietminh (the Communist-led guerrillas who had fought against the French) under Ho Chi Minh seized Hanoi and proclaimed an independent Vietnam before the French could re-establish their presence at the end of World War II.  ''Everything done after that by the French and the Americans was an attempt to turn back the clock, but they couldn't succeed,'' adds Mr. Marr, a former leading antiwar activist who is one of the few professors with military experience in Vietnam; he learned Vietnamese in the Marines. ''The outcome was predetermined. For the Communists were able to gain and hold legitimacy as a patriotic front.''  Says Professor Elliott of Pomona College, ''In 1945, the Vietminh clearly had overwhelming popular support - even the United States at first recognized this'' (an O.S.S. team had worked with Ho at the time). ''The Vietminh,'' he continues, ''won the war again in 1954 at Dien Bien Phu, and the Communists won it a third time in early 1965, before Johnson's commitment of U.S. ground forces.''  Mr. Popkin, among others, disagrees with this kind of deterministic interpretation. ''It's anti-intellectual; it doesn't allow for the normal process of change which occurs in history,'' he counters. ''If you argue that the Communists should have won the war in 1975 because they were the most popular group in 1945, does that mean that we should have a Democratic President today because Roosevelt was elected in 1944?'' Mr. Popkin himself is a liberal Democrat.  A very different view of the relations between Peking and Hanoi is also emerging. Early in the war, some Administration officials, like then Secretary of State Dean Rusk, contended that American commitment was necessary because North Vietnam was acting as an agent of Chinese Communist aggression. But if American diplomacy was able to salvage anything of value from the war, it was improved relations with China. The split between Hanoi and Peking grew out of centuries of enmity between the two countries and China's growing concern that the Vietnamese Communists were aligning themselves with the Soviet Union, China's erstwhile ally.  The break between North Vietnam and China has produced intriguing new evidence about another long-disputed topic: Who was responsible for failing to hold the 1956 elections, which, under the terms of the 1954 Geneva Conference that ended the French Indochina war, would have reunified North and South Vietnam?  In the past, many liberal antiwar critics blamed the Eisenhower Administration for encouraging President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam to ignore the elections. They argued that it was only because of the provision for the elections that Ho Chi Minh had agreed to the temporary division of Vietnam at Geneva, and that when the elections were not held, the Communists had little choice but to resume the war. But Vietnam's leaders now claim that the Chinese actually cut off military aid to them in 1954 to compel them to negotiate with the French and accept the division of the country. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's Prime Minister, told Mr. Karnow that he had said at the time: ''The Chinese have betrayed us.'' And several scholars have found records indicating that Zhou Enlai, China's Prime Minister, expected the separation of Vietnam to be long lasting and turned down Ho's request in 1956 for help in arranging the elections. This does not exonerate Washington for its role in discouraging the elections, says Professor Tai, but it shows that the United States was not alone.  Disclosures from Hanoi since 1975 are also making possible a reexamination of the Vietcong's growth. During the war, the most influential academic account of the origins of the National Liberation Front (N.L.F.), the formal name for the Vietcong, was in a book by two Cornell professors, George McT. Kahin and John W. Lewis, ''The United States in Vietnam.'' The authors argued forcefully that the Vietcong was ''Southern rooted.''  After the Geneva settlement, the authors contended, the Communists withdrew all their armed troops to the newly created North Vietnam, leaving behind only political cadres. Hanoi favored only political, not armed, resistance to Ngo Dinh Diem. But given the ''harshness and heavy-handedness of Diem's Government'' these Southerners ''lost patience with the Communist North'' and organized an insurgency led by the N.L.F. ''Hanoi, despite its reluctance, was then obliged to sanction the Southerners' actions.''  Professors Kahin and Lewis also asserted that there was no evidence that Hanoi encouraged ''militant tactics by the Southerners'' until as late as September 1960, or, contrary to United States Government claims, that Hanoi directed the formation of the N.L.F., which was a broad united front of Communist and non-Communist organizations.  Scholars still agree that most of the early Vietcong were Southerners and that there were factional disputes in Hanoi over how to pursue the insurgency during the 1950's. But a history published by the People's Army of Vietnam in 1980, titled ''The Anti-U.S. Resistance War for National Salvation, 1954-1975: Military Events,'' contends that Hanoi played a large role in the development of the Vietcong. The history records, for example, that as early as 1957 ''cadres and men who remained behind'' in the South were able to form ''37 armed companies.''  Moreover, the history also admits that in a secret directive by the North Vietnamese Politburo in May 1959, Hanoi ordered its Southern supporters to switch from political action to armed struggle. To provide help for the new fighting, Hanoi established a special task force, code named Group 559, which set up infiltration routes and moved ''people, weapons and supplies'' through Laos into South Vietnam.  When the N.L.F. was proclaimed in December 1960, this official Communist history goes on, it was done at the order of the party in Hanoi, and the Front's program ''followed the line delineated by our party.'' These actions marked a critical turning point in the war, leading to the formation of bigger Vietcong units and an increase in attacks on South Vietnamese Government posts. It was this stepped-up activity that confronted President Kennedy when he took office in 1961 and led him to increase the number of American advisers in South Vietnam.  On another critical question, too, the Communists have been more candid since the end of the war: When did they begin sending regular North Vietnamese troops into the South?  Washington had long maintained that Hanoi started infiltrating its regular army units in the fall of 1964, prompting President Johnson's decision to begin bombing North Vietnam and then to dispatch American ground forces to South Vietnam a few months later. Hanoi denied it had troops in the South until virtually the end of the war. When I visited North Vietnam in 1969, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said with a straight face that there were no Northern troops in the South. And antiwar activists dismissed State Department white papers on Northern infiltration. But when Mr. Karnow interviewed officials in Hanoi in 1981, they talked about enlarging the Ho Chi Minh Trail as early as 1964.  All this leads to another question raised by the new scholarship: Were Americans, grown suspicious of their own Government, too eager to accept as truth whatever the Vietnamese Communists said? Throughout the war, there was heated debate over the degree of autonomy the N.L.F. enjoyed. Was it merely a puppet of North Vietnam, as many American officials insisted, or was it an independent organization, as the Communists claimed? The argument was important, because if the N.L.F. was independent, there might had been a chance for a negotiated settlement in the South.  Harrison E. Salisbury, who was among the first correspondents allowed to visit Hanoi in late 1966, made a strong case for the independence of the N.L.F. in his book ''Behind the Lines - Hanoi.'' The N.L.F., Mr. Salisbury wrote, ''had a government. It had a cabinet ... its own troops, its own generals, its own petty officials ... .''  From talks with an N.L.F. official in Hanoi, Mr. Salisbury said, he learned that the Front got its weapons directly from the Soviet Union and China and did not ''utilize Hanoi as a middleman.'' ''All military decisions in the South were the responsibility of the South.'' When Mr. Salisbury quizzed Prime Minister Dong on what would happen when the war was over, the Prime Minister assured him that the North would not annex the South: ''Reunification would only be by mutual agreement.'' Mr. Salisbury came away convinced that American officials who derided the N.L.F. were missing ''genuine possibilities'' for peace.  Asked recently if he might have been misled by the Communists, Mr. Salisbury said, ''I'll stand by my reporting of the time.'' But, he added, he had been in Hanoi in early 1967 and ''by the time the war finally ended the situation was so vastly different that whatever had been said by myself, or Hanoi, or L.B.J. or anybody in the N.L.F. really had very little validity.''  Since the war, some members of the N.L.F. have contended they themselves had been deceived by Hanoi. Writing last fall in The New York Review of Books, Truong Nhu Tang, the former Minister of Justice in the N.L.F.'s government and a French-educated ''independent socialist,'' indicated that he joined the Vietcong because he believed the Communists' promises that they would work for an autonomous, democratic South. At the end of the war, Hanoi annexed the South and the N.L.F. was disbanded.  At ''the simple farewell dinner'' held to disband the N.L.F. in 1976, Mr. Tang recalled, neither the party nor the Government bothered to send a representative. ''I was tragically wrong'' about the Communists, he wrote. ''The North Vietnamese Communists, survivors of protracted, blood-drenched campaigns against colonialism, interventionism and human oppression, became in their turn colonialists, interventionists and architects of one of the world's most rigid re-gimes.'' For the first time in Vietnam's history, Mr. Tang went on, people risked their lives to flee the country -something they had not done under the French or the Americans. Mr. Tang himself escaped by boat in 1979 and now lives in Paris.  American antiwar writers had envisioned a far happier future for Vietnam. One such writer was Frances FitzGerald, who wrote ''Fire in the Lake,'' a book that was both the most widely read and most highly acclaimed volume to come out of the war. (It won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the Bancroft Prize in history in 1973.) In the lyrical closing passage, Miss FitzGerald prophesied: ''Pressure is building towards one of those sudden historical shifts when 'individualism' and its attendant corruption gives way to the discipline of the revolutionary community. When this shift takes place ... it will simply mean that the moment has arrived for the narrow flame of revolution to cleanse the lake of Vietnamese society from the corruption and disorder of the American war.''  ''Fire in the Lake'' had its critics from the start. Mr. Marr, the authority on Vietnamese nationalism, pointed out in a scholarly review at the time of the book's publication that Miss FitzGerald did not know Vietnamese and charged that her depiction of Vietnamese national character was ''little short of disastrous.'' Mr. Popkin at San Diego suspects she was ''swept away by a love affair with the N.L.F.'' and that her belief that the Vietnamese would be happier under the Communists was ''racist and condescending.''  Miss FitzGerald rejects the charge that she was too romantic about the Communists. ''I'd stick with it,'' she says. ''I think it's written in a rather romantic style; one chooses rhetorical modes to make people understand certain things.'' As for Vietnam's terrible postwar troubles, she insists they are the result of the damage caused by the war, though she concedes the Communists have proved inept at running the economy.  POLITICAL COMPROMISES  What went wrong on the American side? Today, the one common note sounded by virtually all scholars is the need to start searching for the answer with President Truman's decision in 1945 to reverse Washington's earlier support for Ho Chi Minh. It was a choice made out of concern for bolstering France in Europe against the looming Soviet menace.  ''In class,'' says Robert A. Scalapino, director of the Institute of East Asian Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, ''I always stress that the history of American involvement in Vietnam was a series of decisions which cumulatively narrowed the choices for each succeeding President. No President was able to begin afresh with Vietnam.''  Professor Scalapino had a reputation as a conservative during the war, but Professor George Kahin, who was an outspoken critic of the war, and was until recently director of Cornell's Southeast Asia program, shares his view. In a new study of American involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967 -which he says is based on trips to Vietnam in the 60's and extensive original research in Government files - Professor Kahin claims he will prove that Washington actually began giving secret military aid to the French for Vietnam in the late 1940's.  ''This aid was officially shown in the records as going to Europe, but it was subverted to Vietnam by the French with U.S. understanding,'' says Professor Kahin. Most history books date the origin of American involvement in Vietnam from a decision by President Truman's National Security Council in 1950 to provide military aid for the French war in Indochina.  Another key turning point whose significance was not appreciated at the time, historians now believe, was the 1963 coup against President Diem. Because the Kennedy Administration sanctioned the coup, Washington became morally and politically responsible for all the regimes that succeeded it, wrote Larry Berman in a new book, ''Planning a Tragedy: The Americanization of the War in Vietnam'' (1982).  Mr. Berman, an associate professor of political science at the University of California at Davis, is one of several writers now offering a more sympathetic portrait of Lyndon Johnson's role in the war. His book focuses on the decision-making process that led up to President Johnson's announcement on July 28, 1965, that he was increasing the number of American troops in Vietnam from 75,000 to 125,000, with additional forces to be deployed as necessary. This move is generally regarded as the critical decision that led to open-ended escalation.  Like a number of the new scholars, Mr. Berman was not trained in Vietnamese studies but is a specialist on the American Presidency. His book is based on recently declassified White House documents he found while doing other research in the Johnson Library in Austin, Tex.  Nowhere in the documents was there evidence that President Johnson had a plan either for winning the war or for getting out. The reason for the absence of any coherent strategic plan is that President Johnson was trying to save his Great Society, not Vietnam. By an accident of history, in July 1965 both Medicare and the Civil Rights Act of 1965 were at crucial stages in Congressional committees; the Model Cities Act and the Higher Education Act were soon to follow. Lyndon Johnson was caught in a dilemma. ''He didn't want to do anything to jeopardize them,'' Mr. Berman wrote. ''He really wanted to be the next face on Mount Rushmore.'' But the Communists were close to victory in Vietnam in early 1965, and President Johnson could not leave himself open to a charge by conservatives that he lost the war. On the other hand, if he took the steps the Pentagon urged - mobilizing the Reserves, for instance - Congressional liberals might have retaliated by withdrawing support for his Great Society programs.  ''So Johnson chose a middle course, to fight the war at the lowest possible cost, on the cheap,'' Mr. Berman went on. ''And he lied about what he was doing. He staged a debate to create a war climate, so that when he announced the number of troops was only going up from 75,000 to 125,000, he looked like a moderate. But he knew there would be 300,000 troops in Vietnam in 1966.''  ''We get a tragic historical figure who had to choose between guns and butter and couldn't,'' Mr. Berman continued. ''In the end, he neither settled the war nor got his Great Society, since as he fought in Vietnam, it drained the money needed for his domestic programs.''  Mr. Berman's thesis is similar to that in a book widely regarded by scholars as a seminal study of America's role in Vietnam - ''The Irony of Vietnam: The System Worked'' (1979), by Leslie H. Gelb, now a correspondent for The New York Times, and Richard K. Betts, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. For this work, the authors drew heavily on the Pentagon Papers, which provided critical new groundwork for analyzing Washington's decision-making process. Mr. Gelb himself was director of the Pentagon Papers project within the Defense Department.  Mr. Gelb and Mr. Betts challenge the old liberal view put forward in books, such as David Halberstam's best seller ''The Best and the Brightest,'' that the United States stumbled into a quagmire in Vietnam through hubris and miscalculation.  Instead, they argue, Washington's planning machinery worked well, providing facts and options for the President. Rarely were the policy makers deluded that the odds for success in Vietnam were high. The trouble was that the Presidents, from Harry Truman to Richard Nixon, were afraid both to risk losing Vietnam to the Communists and to accept the decisive recommendations of their military advisers, which could lead to war with China or a domestic backlash. So they chose the in-between option, doing only what was necessary to stave off a Communist takeover at the time. This prevented a Communist victory till 1975. But their policies of gradual escalation played into the hands of the North Vietnamese, whose strategy was to drag out the war and make it increasingly costly to the United States.  In effect, the Presidents chose to ''nibble the bullet rather than bite it,'' Mr. Betts said at a conference on ''The U.S. Experience in Vietnam'' held last month at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.  Another factor in Washington's decision making, scholars now say, was that in the 1960's American political scientists were fascinated by theories of how the United States could effectively fight limited wars, as opposed to all-out conventional or nuclear wars. Theorists explored the question of how a nation could use force or the threat of force to compel its adversary to back down. Implicit in their theories was the idea that it was possible to signal your opponent by gradually increasing threats.  In another new study, ''When Governments Collide: Coercion and Diplomacy in the Vietnam Conflict, 1964-1968'' (1980), Wallace J. Thies has shown how President Johnson and his advisers believed they could ''fine-tune'' the bombing and their peace offers to ''signal'' Hanoi to abandon its support for the Vietcong. But President Johnson's program suffered from two serious flaws, argues Mr. Thies, a professor of political science at Berkeley.  First of all, in a bureaucracy as large as the American Government, it proved impossible to ''orchestrate'' our bombing and diplomacy. For example, the selection and timing of bombing targets often depended on extraneous factors like the weather; coordination between the Air Force and diplomats was difficult. As a result, what Washington intended to be a show of firmness often appeared to Hanoi to be vacillation or weakness.  Second, Mr. Thies contends, Washington had little understanding of politics in Hanoi and did not realize that the dominant group in the leadership, headed by Le Duan, the party First Secretary, had staked their careers on victory in the South after prolonged factional debate. By 1965, these men had already worked at infiltration and organizing the war in the South for many years. Like their American counterparts, they could not afford to be charged with losing South Vietnam.  Compared with the numerous new studies on the origins of American involvement in Vietnam, there has been little written on the war after 1966, and especially after the Tet offensive in 1968, largely because of the unavailability of materials. At the Johnson Library, relatively few documents have been declassified for the period after 1965, and given Federal budget cutbacks and the Reagan Administration's tightened procedures for declassification, library officials say further progress will be slow.  The situation is even worse for the Nixon years. There is no equivalent of the Pentagon Papers for Mr. Nixon's Presidency and there is no Nixon Presidential library yet. So scholars are heavily dependent on the memoirs of Mr. Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.  One of the best accounts, however, has been pieced together by George C. Herring, a professor of American history at the University of Kentucky and author of ''America's Longest War: The United States and Vietnam, 1950-1975'' (1979). Mr. Herring believes that President Nixon, like his predecessors, early on rejected calls for withdrawal - which he saw as dishonorable - and appeals for sharply increased escalation, feeling that he could solve a riddle that had baffled earlier Presidents.  Mr. Nixon's eventual strategy - Vietnamization -emerged on an improvised basis without a thorough policy review, Mr. Herring contends. In a paper written for the recent conference on Vietnam in Washington, Mr. Herring charged that during the first year of his Administration Mr. Nixon's policy may have been ''a classic case of the President appeasing various bureaucratic constituencies by giving them a bit of what they wanted.'' The military got to bomb North Vietnam's sanctuaries in Cambodia; Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird got a speeded-up pull-out of American troops from Vietnam to appease American opinion (with Vietnamization, the war was turned over to the South Vietnamese Army - ARVN -which was given new training and improved weapons) and the State Department got negotiations with Hanoi. But Mr. Herring concludes that President Nixon's plan did not provide either enough force to compel North Vietnam to negotiate or sufficient concessions to entice Hanoi to the table. Like the improvised strategies of the Johnson era, ''it offered only extended stalemate.''  That there could be a negotiated end to the fighting was, throughout the war, one of the most consistent beliefs of both policy makers in Washington and their critics. But Allan E. Goodman, a professor at Georgetown University, believes this was naive. In another of the new books, ''The Lost Peace: America's Search for a Negotiated Settlement of the Vietnam War'' (1978), he argues that ''The real obstacle to a negotiated settlement was probably not Washington's diplomacy,'' but ''as Hanoi maintained ever since its first direct conversation with Washington in 1962, the liberation of South Vietnam was an absolutely indispensable prerequisite'' for a settlement.  In other words, North Vietnam was not prepared to compromise. Hanoi was further encouraged when American spokesmen assured it that American bombing of North Vietnam was not intended to destroy the country. The North Vietnamese were aware that the longer the war went on the more painful it was for the United States. So Hanoi waited for Washington to make the concessions.  In the end, this was what happened. ''Nearly every time Washington made a negotiating offer to Hanoi, the U.S. terms softened,'' Mr. Goodman wrote, until finally, in the Paris talks in 1972, Mr. Kissinger agreed that the United States would withdraw from Vietnam without obtaining a comparable pledge from Hanoi.  Without access to more documents from the period, it is impossible to judge if President Nixon and Mr. Kissinger believed the Paris accords gave South Vietnam a real chance to survive or whether they felt the agreement was merely a face-saving ''decent interval'' during which the United States could disentangle itself from Vietnam. Either way, America's exit from Vietnam proved as stumbling as its entry.  THE MILITARY CONFUSION  A conundrum that has baffled a generation of American military officers is this: The Army won every battle it fought against the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese, inflicting terrible losses on them. Yet Hanoi emerged the victor. When Col. Harry G. Summers Jr. was in Hanoi in 1975 as part of the American military delegation overseeing the Peace Accords, he mentioned to a North Vietnamese officer that the Communists had never defeated the Americans on the battlefield. The North Vietnamese colonel replied: ''That may be so, but it is also irrelevant.''  In the years since, Colonel Summers, an instructor at the Army War College at Carlisle, Pa., has found that, despite the welter of writing about Vietnam, few scholars have re-examined the military side of the war. To try to fill this void, Colonel Summers, who fought in Korea and served two tours in Vietnam, has turned out one of the most thoughtful and provocative military studies of the war, titled ''On Strategy: A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War'' (1982).  Unlike some senior American commanders, Colonel Summers does not blame the politicians, the protesters or the press for America's defeat. Instead, he finds flaws in the military's own approach. Most important, the Army simply lacked a strategy - an unforgivable sin for a soldier.  Instead of having a strategy, Colonel Summers argues, military and policy planners got carried away by the mystique of fighting a counterinsurgency war. In Colonel Summers's view, North Vietnam was the real opponent, but because Hanoi hid its involvement behind a smokescreen of guerrillas, the United States got tied down in fighting those insurgents. ''We were like a bull charging the toreador's cape,'' he comments.  The result was that the Army got caught up in General Westmoreland's search-and-destroy operations, which cost the lives of many American soldiers, outraged public opinion and did not deal with the real source of Communist strength - North Vietnam. Because of their helicopters and firepower, American forces may have had the tactical initiative, but they confused that with the strategic initiative, which Hanoi had all along.  Operating from their sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia, the Communists controlled the tempo of the fighting, and no matter how many Communists the Americans killed, success depended on the number of men Hanoi started down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In this war of attrition, North Vietnam could not be beaten as long as it was willing to pay the price.  Where most critics of American military policy in Vietnam have argued that the United States tried to fight a guerrilla war using conventional tactics, Colonel Summers contends - in one of his most controversial points -that it had always been a conventional war. The French in Indochina fought against a guerrilla army, he admits, but Hanoi's use of the Vietcong as proxies obfuscated the issue.  The United States could have had a strategy, Colonel Summers maintains. Since our goal was much the same as it had been in Korea, he believes, to stop the expansion of a Communist state, we could have pursued a Korean solution - cutting off North Vietnam from the South.  Quoting a plan first advanced by retired Gen. Bruce Palmer Jr., a former deputy commander of the American Army in Vietnam, Colonel Summers suggests that, with an expanded naval blockade, the army should have driven across the Demilitarized Zone between the two Vietnams and then cut through Laos to the Thai border, setting up defensive positions.  ''This would have had a number of advantages,'' says Colonel Summers. It would have required far fewer American troops. We could have fought on the defensive, making maximum use of our best asset, our firepower, and reducing our casualties. And it would have left rooting out the guerrillas to the South Vietnamese Army, which was best equipped to do it, and would have kept Americans out of the villages.  Colonel Summers rejects the argument that this strategy would have violated the neutrality of Laos and Cambodia, which he thinks was a fiction. ''The North Vietnamese never made a secret they were fighting an Indochina war,'' he says, and, in fact, the new North Vietnamese history of the war admits that Hanoi had ''volunteers'' in Laos as early as 1959. ''Neutrality was a myth we inflicted on ourselves,'' says Colonel Summers. He also quotes from the Hague Convention of 1907: ''A neutral country has the obligation not to allow its territory to be used by a belligerent. If the neutral country is unwilling or unable to prevent this, the other belligerent has the right to take appropriate counteraction.''  Colonel Summers also contends that the generals should have insisted that President Johnson get a Congressional declaration of war before committing American troops to Vietnam. President Johnson's attempt to fight the war on the cheap, without telling the public about its real costs, led to the credibility gap and helped spread the antiwar movement.  It was this lack of popular support for the war which also fostered the idea that the Vietnam War was more immoral than other wars, Colonel Summers believes. ''People talk about the picture of the little girl running down the road who got napalmed,'' he says. ''But tens of thousands of little girls got incinerated in the fire-bomb raids on Dresden and Tokyo in World War II and we don't remember. The difference is we believed World War II was legitimate.''  To underscore this point, Colonel Summers quotes from an article by General Weyand, the last American commander in Vietnam: ''As military professionals we must speak out, we must counsel our political leaders and alert the American public that there is no such thing as a 'splendid little war.' ... War is death and destruction. The American way of war is particularly violent, deadly and dreadful. We believe in using 'things' - artillery, bombs, massive firepower -in order to conserve our soldiers' lives. ... The Army must make the price of involvement clear before we get involved, so that America can weigh the probable costs of involvement against the dangers of noninvolvement. For there are worse things than war.'' Like a number of officers, Colonel Summers raises the question of why some members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not resign in protest when they sensed the lack of a coherent strategy and President Johnson's attempt to fight the war with limited means.  At the recent conference on Vietnam in Washington, retired Brig. Gen. Edwin H. Simmons, the director of Marine Corps History and Museums, said that he had asked some of the Chiefs the question himself. ''The inevitable answer is: They could work better from within,'' said General Simmons, who served two tours in Vietnam with the Marines. It was one of the distortions of the Vietnam War, he said, that some officers allowed the honored principle of civilian control of the military to come to mean civilian leadership and management of the military on the combat level in the field. Officers at all levels of command ''used civilian control as an exoneration from moral responsibility,'' he charged.  General Simmons is currently supervising a 10-volume official history of the Marines in Vietnam, one of a series of such projects by each of the armed services. Taken together, they consti-tute the most ambitious and detailed work now being done on the war. The largest in scope is a planned 20-volume series by the Army's Center of Military History in Washington.  The Army's earlier 80-volume history of World War II has received high marks from scholars for its integrity. But Vincent H. Demma -one of 10 historians selected to help write the Vietnam volumes and who has been working on the project since the mid-1960's - admits that victory is easier to record than defeat. Moreover, the writers face another problem, a wealth of documentation left over from a conflict that was not only the first television war, but also the first Xerox and computer war. In Suitland, Md., outside Washington, in a warehouse the size of three football fields, repose more than 60,000 cubic feet of records shipped home by the Army, mostly uncatalogued.  Mr. Demma hopes this material and other archives, including taperecorded interviews with officers as they left Vietnam, will someday furnish what is now missing - ''an understanding of the war from the foxhole up rather than from the policy makers down.'' Aside from some novels by ex-soldiers, very little has been written on the actual conduct of the war, says Mr. Demma. But he feels that the special access he and his fellow authors have to still-classified material, including that in the Presidential libraries and other Government organizations like the Central Intelligence Agency, should eventually provide a more accurate picture of Vietnam.  THE VIETNAM IGNORANCE  Despite all the blunders, a number of historians and military specialists are coming to conclude that the American military effort in Vietnam was more successful than was recognized at the time. When Mr. Popkin, for instance, returned to Vietnam in 1969 and 1970 to check on the villages he had studied in 1966, he was surprised to find that the balance of power in the countryside had shifted dramatically in the South Vietnamese Government's favor.  This was, in part, the result of the huge Communist mistake in the 1968 Tet offensive, when the best Vietcong units, which had long preserved their strength by operating clandestinely, exposed themselves in open attacks. They were decimated by American and South Vietnamese counterat-tacks. American officials estimated the Communists lost 40,000 killed in the Tet fighting, the bulk of them Southern guerrillas rather than North Vietnamese.  Mr. Tang, the former N.L.F. Minister of Justice, has described Tet as ''catastrophic''; he calculated the Vietcong lost half their forces and new recruits could not be found lo-cally to replace them. As a result, by the early 70's, 90 percent of the fighting was being done by North Vietnamese troops and the war turned more and more into a conventional conflict between North and South. (Mr. Pike and some other specialists have speculated that Hanoi may have deliberately allowed the Vietcong to be massacred at Tet to assure North Vietnam's control over the Communist movement in the South, much as the advancing Russian Army stood by during the Warsaw uprising in 1944.) But at the time, most Americans, shocked by the daring Vietcong attack on the United States Embassy in Saigon and the weeks of street fighting in Hue, felt Tet was a defeat for the United States. It led to President Johnson's announcement that he would not run again, his proclamation of a bombing halt over North Vietnam and his decision to stop the escalation of American ground forces. For most Americans, Tet was the beginning of the end of our involvement.  Even those American officials and journalists who claimed in 1968 that Tet was a military defeat for the Communists still tended to credit Hanoi with a masterful strategy -sacrificing troops to deal Washington a psychological blow. But that view, too, was wrong.  When he was in Vietnam for his television series, Mr. Karnow interviewed Tran Do, one of the Communist generals in charge of the Tet attacks. The general denied that Tet was designed to have a political impact in the United States; instead, he said, the Communists fully believed there would be popular uprisings and that they could ''annihilate the U.S. and Saigon troops.'' The political impact ''was an accidental byproduct,'' the general said. Major popular uprisings never took place.  Tet, in fact, ''totally destroyed the idea of the inevitability of an N.L.F. victory in the villages,'' says Mr. Popkin. ''When the villagers saw the stacks of Vietcong bodies in Saigon on their local TV sets, they rushed to get their sons into local defense forces'' so that they would not be drafted by the Vietcong.  At the same time, the sheer weight of American military spending and aid programs began to be felt. Many peasants rushed to work for the Americans, building roads, bridges, runways and schools. Typically, Mr. Popkin found, in the 18 villages he studied, the peasants used their earnings to buy a baby piglet, raised it, sold it, and with the profits invested in a diesel water pump to irrigate their rice fields. With these mechanized pumps the farmers in the Mekong Delta could at last get two rice crops a year, and the standard of living in the countryside started to take off.  In the early and mid-1960's, the peasants had had an economic incentive to live in a ''liberated'' or Communist village, Mr. Popkin found, because the Vietcong taxes were lower than the rent peasants had to pay landlords in Government-held areas. But by the time of Tet, the incentive was reversed. As the Vietcong's military situation grew more desperate, their taxes increased. And now that the peasants had pigs, chickens and rice they could sell in Government markets, they got angry when the Communists cut a road. ''The Vietcong may have been more honest than the Government, but they couldn't compete with water pumps, chemical fertilizer and Hondas,'' says Mr. Popkin. He has developed some of his ideas about the farmers' material interests in a book widely used in college courses, titled ''The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam'' (1979).  In the light of Hanoi's postwar revelations, specialists are revising even their views of the Phoenix program, the scheme sponsored by the C.I.A. to destroy the Vietcong apparatus in the villages by arresting or killing local Communist cadres. ''The conven tional liberal wisdom at the time was that it was a terrible thing,'' says Mr. Karnow. ''It killed people indiscriminately and was subject to corruption by the South Vietnamese who turned in people for the reward money. But the people I talked to on my trip in Vietnam said it had wiped out many Southern cadres and helped cripple the N.L.F.''  Overall, by 1970 nearly 90 percent of the countryside was officially ''pacified,'' compared with only 33 percent in 1965, a crude though significant index of change.  Professor Herring at the University of Kentucky has suggested that ''the ultimate irony'' of the war may be that the American position in South Vietnam was stronger at the end of 1972, just before the Paris peace agreement, than at any previous point in the war. Mr. Popkin concurs and adds, ''There's no doubt that if Nixon had kept up U.S. aid after 1973, South Vietnam might have survived.'' But that is one of the great historical ifs. American patience had run out.  What, then, went wrong after the Paris accords? Why did South Vietnam collapse in 1975 under a North Vietnamese attack that was designed only to prepare for a bigger, final offensive in 1976? (According to Douglas Pike, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the North Vietnamese commander, was so startled by the rapidity of the South Vietnamese retreat that he cautioned his officers in the field by radio against falling into a trap.) Clearly one problem was the poor leadership and corruption that bedeviled the Saigon Government throughout the war. But Professor Tai believes that in fairness we should recognize that Saigon faced problems Hanoi did not have. North Vietnam could forge a more disciplined state because its society was more homogeneous than that of the South. Most anti-Communists in the North moved to the South in 1954, and the North never had to deal with the South's fractious babble of sects like the Buddhists, the Hoa Hao and the Cao Dai.  Mrs. Tai also believes that the American peace movement misunderstood how the South Vietnamese people felt. ''There were many people like me who did not support Thieu but who didn't like the Communists either,'' she says. Indeed, she represented the kind of third force that American officials in Saigon hoped would somehow emerge. ''I didn't think a Communist victory would lead to any improvement for the middle class, or even for the peasants, in whose name the revolution was fought,'' she says. In 1977, her father, despite his Communist background, was arrested for protesting the human-rights situation in Vietnam; he died of starvation in a ''reeducation'' camp in 1981.  On the basis of his village interviews, Mr. Popkin also came to a conclusion that the American left overrated the popularity of the Communists. With his training in polling, Mr. Popkin noticed a number of ''unobtrusive indicators.'' ''When you want to know what radio stations people are listening to,'' he says, ''you don't ask them. You just look in their cars at a parking lot to see where the dials are set.''  One sign was that while many South Vietnamese soldiers deserted to go home -just as Union troops did in the American Civil War - they did not defect in large units to the Communists. This was in sharp contrast to China, where during the 1940's whole Nationalist divisions defected to Mao Zedong's Communist guerrillas. Mr. Popkin noted, too, that in the Tet offensive, when the Communists' surprise attacks trapped many Americans in Vietnamese residential areas, very few were betrayed to the Communists.  ''It tells you,'' says Mr. Popkin, ''that the problem in Vietnam was not too much support for the Communists, or lack of support for the Saigon Government. It was just a rotten government. You can't fight something with nothing.''  Another reason for Saigon's collapse in 1975, South Vietnamese and American officials have long insisted, was the cutback in American aid mandated by a Congress which lost interest in the war after the G.I.'s had left in 1973.  American military aid to South Vietnam and Laos dropped from about $2.5 billion in 1973 to $1.6 billion in 1974 and then plunged further to a projected $700 million in 1975, half of it covering shipping costs. When Hanoi's attack came, South Vietnam's armed forces were receiving only 2 percent of the funds and supplies American soldiers had gotten in 1968 or 1969, according to retired Maj. Gen. John E. Murray, the chief American military administrator in Saigon in 1974. In other words, said Gen. Van Tien Dung, North Vietnam's field commander, in his memoir on the final offensive, the Thieu regime was compelled ''to fight a poor man's war,'' a fact that Hanoi took carefully into account.  ''You know what Napoleon said,'' General Murray pointed out at the conference on Vietnam in Washington. ''God is on the side of the biggest battalions. And right about then, God was on the side of the Communists. They were bigger, they were stronger. That's why ARVN lost the war.''  But there was something else at work. The huge American investment in Vietnam, Mr. Karnow points out, had ''lulled the South Vietnamese into believing that the United States would never leave. Nobody in his right mind would spend billions to build the complex at Cam Ranh Bay and then depart. The Americans must be crazy. They were crazy. The South Vietnamese were left holding the bag.''  Professor Elliott at Pomona College thinks this dependence is the key to understanding the war. ''It seems to me,'' he says, ''that the Communists had an appeal that prevented the South Vietnamese from coalescing around a non-Communist government. Because the Saigon regimes were always dependent on the United States, in the eyes of the nationalistic Vietnamese, this created a moral paralysis.'' Mr. Elliott says he could see this in interviews he conducted with Vietcong defectors in the Mekong Delta during the war. ''However much they had come to dislike the Communists, they acknowledged the Front had a moral appeal which undermined the Government.'' So the South Vietnamese faced an insoluble contradiction. ''They couldn't win without us, but they couldn't win with us either.''  THE ANTI WAR MOVEMENT  One group whose influence on Vietnam has been downgraded by the new scholars is the antiwar movement. From studying public-opinion polls, John E. Mueller, a professor of political science at the University of Rochester, has found that the Vietnam War was no more unpopular than the Korean War - until American casualties in Vietnam surpassed those in Korea. That line was crossed, coincidentally, during the Tet offensive. Professor Mueller believes that the tactics of some of the protesters, with flag burnings and anti-American slogans, actually undercut their credibility with the public. ''The antiwar movement picked up negative popularity ratings in an almost unprecedented degree,'' he says.  Washington was certainly aware of the protests, says Mr. Mueller, who has written about the subject in ''War, Presidents and Public Opinion'' (1973). But the Johnson Administration's about-faces in 1968 - stopping the bombing of North Vietnam and ending our troop escalation -had more to do with disaffection within the Government itself over how badly the war was going and its high costs, he asserts.  Another little-known reason for the Government's shift in 1968, Mr. Mueller has found, is that within the Government ''the value of saving Vietnam from Communism had gone down since we got committed in 1965.'' China, formerly seen as a threat, had become engulfed in the Cultural Revolution, and Indonesia, which had appeared on the brink of a Communist takeover, massacred its Communist Party.  Mr. Mueller also points out that President Johnson's near defeat by Senator Eugene McCarthy in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, which influenced President Johnson's decision not to run again, was caused more by angry hawks than by doves. At the ballot box, anti-Johnson hawks outnumbered anti-Johnson doves by 3 to 2.  The protesters did have an effect on the Presidential elections. Their attacks on Vice President Humphrey ''probably gave Nixon the slim margin of votes necessary to win in 1968,'' says Mr. Mueller. Then, in 1972, with the Democratic convention controlled by opponents of the war, ''they picked George McGovern, arguably the worst choice as a Democratic candidate in modern times.''  But Mr. Mueller discounts the charge by hawks that the protest movement strengthened Hanoi's resolve and helped the United States lose Vietnam. ''Hanoi may have been encouraged by the peace movement,'' he says, ''but the North Vietnamese were fanatics who would have continued the war for as long as necessary to win.'' In another of his studies, Mr. Mueller estimated that the North Vietnamese and Vietcong suffered 500,000 to 600,000 battle deaths - about 2.5 percent to 3 percent of their prewar population. By comparison, the United States lost only three-tenths of 1 percent of its population in battle during World War II, and the Japanese, whom Americans regarded as true fanatics, 1.4 percent. ''The crucial mistake the U.S. made was to underestimate how much punishment North Vietnam would take,'' he says.  THE LESSON OF VIETNAM  Are there lessons Americans can learn from Vietnam? The question is important, because it was one of the supposed lessons of World War II -not to appease aggression - that helped get the United States into Vietnam. There is little consensus, however, on what can be gleaned from Vietnam. James C. Thomson Jr., curator at the Nieman Foundation at Harvard, who was a member of President Johnson's National Security Council staff and who opposed American involvement in Vietnam, has proposed that the ''central lesson'' is that we should never again ''take on the job of trying to defeat a nationalist anticolonial movement under indigenous Communist control in former French Indochina.'' This is, notes Mr. Thomson wryly, ''a lesson of less than universal significance.''  But Robert E. Osgood, a professor of American foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, believes Americans have learned the danger of intervening in a revolutionary war where the local government is weak. In such cases, the United States must commit so many troops to compensate for the regime's shortcomings that it ends up only undermining the government. El Salvador is an example, says Professor Osgood, who was one of the most important theorists on limited war in the 1960's.  ''But this is not necessarily a lesson you can apply in every revolutionary war,'' he adds. In the Philippines after World War II, American aid provided a critical ''missing component'' that stopped a Communist insurgency. So to exclude American intervention in every contingency ''is probably overdrawing the lesson,'' he says.  The problem, in Professor Osgood's view, is that there are many variables for Washington to ponder: the strength of the local regime, the resolve of its adversary, the possibilities for getting out if American intervention proves unsuccessful.  The real issue is the magnitude of American interests and the threat to them. ''That was a mistake in Vietnam -our greatly inflated rhetoric about falling dominoes turned out to be wrong,'' Professor Osgood points out. But American foreign policy is still wedded to containment, and questions may arise again about combating a Communist-led revolution or takeover in the Middle East or Central America, he notes.  If that prospect arises, says Mr. Betts, we have not really learned what to do except that the United States can fight only if the war is kept short. ''We know more now,'' he believes, but we do not know how to avoid a disastrous war except at the possible price that Presidents Kennedy and Johnson foresaw -disastrous acceptance of defeat.  Another lesson is the need for better leadership, says Ernest R. May, a professor of history at Harvard. At the Washington conference on Vietnam, he recalled that in 1948 George C. Marshall, then Secretary of State, opposed a military proposal to send 10,000 American advisers to aid the Chinese Nationalists because it involved a commitment of uncertain magnitude and indefinite duration. ''What we did not have in 1965 was an individual of Marshall's stature and independent judgment,'' Mr. May said.  There are also lessons for small states that might look to the United States for help. At the Washington meeting, Bui Diem, who served as South Vietnam's Ambassador to the United States, issued a warning. ''My advice to small nations considering U.S. aid is that they should be wary of the United States,'' he said. ''They should pay very close attention to the American domestic political system, because U.S. policies can change quickly. We small nations can end up losing higher stakes than the United States itself because, for the American, you can turn the page and say, 'Well, it is an unhappy chapter for U.S. history.' But that is not the same now for the South Vietnamese.''  And there are lessons for the military. The most important, Colonel Summers believes, is that ''we must relearn that public support is critical to American military strategy.'' To make his point, Colonel Summers quotes from General Weyand, the man who welcomed the P.O.W.'s to Saigon in 1973. ''The American Army really is a people's army in the sense that it belongs to the American people,'' the general said. ''When the American people lose their commitment, it is futile to try to keep the Army committed. In the final analysis, the American Army is not so much an arm of the executive branch as it is an arm of the American people.''  TEACHING THE WAR  UP at the blackboard, a teaching assistant had chalked in the Names to be discussed in the day's lecture at the University of Iowa. There, in large letters, were Robert McNamara, and McGeorge Bundy, and Ngo Dinh Diem and the Green Berets.  Fifteen years ago, when Vietnam first invaded the American campus, they would all have been household words, objects of heated debate and perhaps derision. But to the 300 students in the large classroom, they were like something from an arcane novel, to be carefully copied down.  ''For the students, history begins about 1980,'' says Stephen Vlastos, a professor of history at the University of Iowa who is in charge of the course, ''The Vietnam War in Historical Perspective.'' Indeed, most of them were not even born at the time of the Americansupported coup against President Diem. Katharyn Bine, a freshman from Beaman, Iowa, a farming town of 209 people, was only 1 year old when Lyndon Johnson dispatched the first American ground forces to Vietnam in 1965. Before taking the course, she had heard the name Ho Chi Minh, but she had not known who Diem or McNamara or Bundy was.  Yet Miss Bine and the course at Iowa represent another development - a quiet revival of interest in Vietnam on campus 10 years after the last American troops were withdrawn. More than two dozen colleges this year are offering courses on the war or Vietnamese history, ranging from Harvard to Thomas More College in northern Kentucky. Almost all the classes have drawn more students than their professors expected.  What are the students learning? It seems to depend on the professor, his own view of Vietnam and the books he assigns. Not surprisingly, a majority of the professors were strongly influenced by the antiwar movement. Mr. Vlastos, for instance, helped organize a demonstration against President Johnson while he was an undergraduate at Princeton in 1966. He is candid about his antiwar sentiments. ''It's the reason I'm teaching the course,'' he says. ''At the beginning of the course, I told the students I believe the war was a terrible mistake.''  Professor Vlastos is also an example of another heritage of academic feeling about the war. Distaste for the war was so widespread that few academics specialized in Vietnam, and so today most of the new courses on Vietnam are being taught by professors who were trained in subjects like American history or Chinese studies. Mr. Vlastos got his Ph.D. from Berkeley in Japanese history.  Even more striking, though nearly three million Americans served in Vietnam, very few of the professors teaching about Vietnam were ever there. At a conference last fall on ''Vietnam and the Classroom'' in Kentucky, sponsored by the Kentucky Association of Teachers of History, only one of the 11 speakers and only three of the 75 participating teachers had been in Vietnam.  ''If we were talking about World War II, this room would be full of veterans,'' observed T. Wayne Beasley, a professor at Murray State University in western Kentucky. But, Mr. Beasley complained, ''with Vietnam you people who are teaching about it are the same people who were protesting it as students in the 1960's.''  At the Newark campus of Rutgers University, H. Bruce Franklin is worried about a different problem. Mr. Franklin, a professor of English, says he was distressed when he polled the students in his course, ''America and Vietnam,'' and found the majority believed the United States lost the war because ''we didn't try hard enough.'' ''This illusion has to be dispelled immediately,'' Mr. Franklin adds. So he stresses the damage the United States did to Vietnam, like bombing it between 1964 and 1969 with more than nine times the tonnage of high explosives dropped in the entire Pacific theater during World War II. Mr. Franklin rejects a suggestion that such figures may be misleading because many of the bombs dropped on Vietnam landed in the jungle, not on civilian villages.  Despite the prevalence of antiwar views among most professors, some teachers have begun to incorporate the more complex and dispassionate new scholarship into their curriculum. One of the most imaginative new classes is at the University of Louisville, taught by an unlikely duo: a hawkish former artillery officer in Vietnam, Richard N. Pfeiffer, and a confirmed antiwar activist with a Ph.D. in East Asian history, Andrea McElderry. Miss McElderry is an associate professor of history; Mr. Pfeiffer is a vice president of an industrial-supply company who teaches in his spare time.  ''The idea of the class is to give the students as many different points of view as we can about the war, because we don't think anyone has solved Vietnam,'' says Miss McElderry. ''We don't let our students say things like 'This side won the war.' ''  To broaden the course, the two teachers invite guest speakers from the Louisville area, including a former Green Beret, a retired Army general, a one-time high official in the Saigon Government, a peacemovement activist and a psychiatrist from a Veterans' Administration hospital who treats troubled veterans. Miss McElderry feels the unusual chemistry between her and Mr. Pfeiffer has been beneficial. ''Until I met Richard, I was sure of my views about Vietnam. He has made me rethink them, and I have influenced him, too. I couldn't have taught the course the same way with my Asian specialist colleagues, because all of them were getting 2-S student deferments during Vietnam.'' - F.B.

"    Ten years ago today, I stood on the floodlit tarmac of Tan Son Nhut air base and watched as a group of 27 American prisoners of war were delivered to freedom by United States Army helicopters. The men had been picked up from a Communistcontrolled rubber plantation near the Cambodian border, and their arrival was the first tangible benefit for Americans of the Paris peace accords, signed in late January.  It was an emotional moment. Gen. Frederick C. Weyand, the last commander of United States forces in Vietnam, draped his arm around an Air Force colleague and confided, in tones just loud enough for me to hear, ''It's the greatest day we've ever had in Vietnam.''  There was a kind of resignation and finality about the remark, like a losing football team salvaging a share of its pride with a meaningless touchdown in the final moments of the game. So it was with Vietnam. With the signing of the Paris agreement and the return of our P.O.W.'s, we withdrew not only the last American combat forces from Vietnam, but also our slender remaining interest in the country.  The war itself, of course, sputtered on for another two years, until Saigon's stunning collapse in April 1975. But Americans went into a trance of collective amnesia. The Vietnam War was such an agonizing, divisive and baffling experience that we somehow resolved simply to forget it. Unlike the fall of Nationalist China to Mao Zedong in 1949, there were no postwar recriminations, no blame for who lost Vietnam. The shock had been so great that nobody wanted to know. As a result, Vietnam became not only the longest war in our history and the first war the United States had lost - it was also the most misunderstood war.  The big questions went unasked and unanswered: How did we get involved in Vietnam? Why did 57,939 Americans die there? Why did the Communists win? What were the lessons of the war?  But now, a decade after the last American troops left Saigon, Vietnam is sparking renewed interest - though without the explosive rancor of the 1960's and early 70's. The hottest star on television is Tom Selleck, who plays Magnum, an amiable private eye and Vietnam veteran whose exploits often involve flashbacks to his combat days in ''Nam.'' Public Television is planning an ambitious 13-hour series on the war, which it will show within a year. The dedication of the polished black granite Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington last November finally gave Vietnam veterans a respected if ambiguous place alongside the monuments to Jefferson, Lincoln and Washington.  Ultimately, the most important development may be the emergence of a small group of scholars, journalists and military specialists who have started to look afresh at the war. Drawing on new disclosures from Hanoi, the opening of documents in the Presidential libraries, the Pentagon Papers (which are still the best published source material on the war) and memoirs of some of the participants in the war, these writers have worked quietly, with the general public largely unaware of their research. For most of these scholars, their re-examination is not to prove whether Vietnam was or was not a ''noble cause,'' in President Reagan's phrase, but to find out what really happened and why. In the process, they are challenging some of the most cherished beliefs of both the right and the left.  Among the new findings are the following: As opposed to the public caricature of him as a warmonger, Lyndon Johnson was actually reluctant to become more deeply involved in Vietnam. He sent American troops to Vietnam not out of machismo, but out of fear that if he ''lost'' South Vietnam, Congress would not pass his Great Society programs.  Contrary to the American popular assumption that we could easily win, American Presidents from John Kennedy to Richard Nixon were never confident about our chances and, in fact, never had a plan to win in Vietnam. Instead, they did only the minimum necessary not to lose Vietnam during their own tenure in the White House. They tried to fight a war on the cheap against a foe, North Vietnam, whose commitment was total.  Under the restrictions imposed by the Presidents, some American generals knew almost from the start that they could not win the war.  Without permission to cut off Hanoi's use of Laos and Cambodia, they realized, the critical strategic initiative remained in Hanoi's hands. Many officers now believe the Joint Chiefs of Staff should have resigned in protest. Both hawks and liberals were wrong about the Communists in Vietnam.  While successive Administrations did not understand that the Communists' appeal had its roots in centuries of Vietnamese xenophobia, many antiwar critics - like Frances FitzGerald in her bestselling ''Fire in the Lake'' - over-glamorized the Vietcong, the Southern insurgents, and underestimated the role that North Vietnam played in leading the war in the South.  The 1968 Tet offensive was a disastrous military defeat for the Communists, as Gen. William C. Westmoreland claimed, though most Americans regarded it as a setback for the United States. It was particularly brutal for the Vietcong, who bore the brunt of the fighting and who suffered such losses that thereafter they had to be replaced by North Vietnamese regulars, turning the conflict into a war between North and South.  After Tet - though most Americans at home had given up on the war - the cumulative weight of American firepower and spending in Vietnam dramatically undercut support for the Communists. As a result, the United States was probably in a stronger position in Vietnam in 1972, just before the Paris peace accords, than at any previous point in the war.  The antiwar movement did not have as much impact on American policy as is popularly thought. Lyndon Johnson's decision in March 1968 to de-escalate the war was not so much a response to the peace movement as a result of disaffection within his Administration over the disastrous costs of the war. The protesters' main contribution, in fact, may have been to help elect Richard Nixon twice - in 1968 over Hubert Humphrey and in 1972 over George McGovern.  The picture of the Vietnam conflict that is emerging from the new research shows a war that was more complex, more morally ambiguous, than either the doves or the hawks had maintained. Of the war's many ironical twists, few match the postwar predicament of Communist Vietnam.  ''It was a war nobody won,'' says Stanley Karnow, a syndicated columnist, who covered Vietnam for several national publications.  ''North Vietnam won, of course, but it also lost.'' Mr. Karnow - who is chief correspondent for Public Television's series on Vietnam and who is writing a book to accompany it - was in Hanoi in 1981 to film some interviews for the series. He remembers asking Prime Minister Pham Van Dong what Vietnam's main problem now is. ''He laughed,'' recalls Mr. Karnow. '' 'That's a stupid question. Look around, you can see for yourself what problems we're having.' ''  Hanoi's grim postwar record has raised a serious problem for scholars. How much should it be taken into account when the war is analyzed? Can events during the war be interpreted in the light of the Communists' postwar detention of 50,000 to 100,000 former supporters of the Saigon regime in ''re-education'' camps, the corruption and economic mismanagement by Communist officials, the invasion of Cambodia, the persecution of Vietnam's large Chinese ethnic minority and the flight of the boat people?  David W.P. Elliott, an assistant professor of political science at Pomona College in California, believes that Vietnam's postwar record is irrelevant to understanding the war. ''We shouldn't commit the historicist fallacy of reading the present into the past,'' says Mr.  Elliott. ''In 1975, the people wanted peace.'' Like many of the new scholars, Mr. Elliott's interest in Vietnam goes back to the 1960's.  He learned Vietnamese in the Army and later did research on the Vietcong for the Rand Corporation, a private research organization working mostly for the Defense Department.  One of the few Vietnamese now teaching in the United States, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, an assistant professor of history at Harvard, agrees that the Communists' postwar failures ''do not vindicate America's crusade in Vietnam.'' For a part of Vietnam's troubles today were caused by the dislocations of the war. But Mrs. Tai, who came to the United States as a student at Brandeis, maintains that what has happened since 1975 offers an important perspective.  ''During the war,'' she says, ''people looked at the Communists and said they were dedicated, driven and omnicompetent. Now we see them as corrupt and incompetent.'' Did the Communists change so much after 1975 or were Americans grossly mistaken in their earlier impressions?  Mrs. Tai believes that many Americans allowed their political passions to cloud their intellect. At the time of the war, she says, ''it was fashionable to think that a guerrilla movement needed popular support to succeed, and that if the Vietcong survived, therefore they must have popular support.'' But that, Mrs. Tai contends, was a fallacious argument. ''You can see how wrong it was now, because the Communists certainly aren't popular in the South.'' Or, she suggests, look at Cambodia. ''Pol Pot came to power as a guerrilla, but looking at what he did to his country, you'd think twice before saying he was popular.''  Mrs. Tai herself cannot be accused of being an inveterate anti-Communist. Her father was a founder of the Trotskyite party in Vietnam; an aunt was a senior official in the Vietcong's Provisional Revolutionary Government. But she has long had reservations about those antiwar protesters who were too ready to turn the Vietnamese Communists into paragons of virtue and who refused to accept a view of the war that was not black and white.  At Brandeis, she remembers, a professor asked her in class what the Vietnamese thought of the war. When she said that it was a difficult question to answer, since the view of an intellectual was probably very different from that of a peasant, the professor became angry. ''Later,'' she says, ''a student told me that my views didn't count because I was a bourgeois. I said, 'I'm sorry; I'm a human being. There are several hundred thousand members of the middle class in Vietnam.' ''  This kind of academic narrow-mindedness, in Mrs. Tai's view, contributed to American misunderstanding of Vietnam just as much as ignorance in the White House and the State Department.  Until quite recently, Vietnam has been a giant black hole in American academia. A survey byin 1970 found that there was no scholar in the United States who devoted most of his or her time to studying North Vietnam; there was no American university with a tenured professorship in Vietnamese studies, and there were fewer than 30 students in the country studying the Vietnamese language. By comparison, there were three times that many studying Thai. According to the Social Science Research Council in New York, from 1951 to 1981 a total of 820 Americans applied to it for financial aid to work on Ph.D. dissertations in Southeast Asia. Of these, only 33 were for Vietnam, almost the same number as for Burma.  John K. Fairbank, professor emeritus of history at Harvard and the man generally recognized as the founder of modern Chinese studies in the United States, refers to this lack of expertise on Vietnam as an academic Pearl Harbor. One reason for this blind spot, he suggests, was that the French excluded American missionaries and businessmen from Vietnam, and Americans therefore did not have a personal stake in Vietnam.  However, by the time the United States became militarily involved, many academics considered the war so immoral that dispassionate analysis of the conflict became almost impossible. Only a handful of scholars actually went to Vietnam to do research there.  One of them was Samuel L. Popkin, now an associate professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego. After he spent time in 1966 conducting interviews in Vietnamese villages, he was treated as a pariah when he returned to Harvard, where he was then an assistant professor.  His problem: He had returned from Vietnam with a complex view. He did not approve of the way the Americans were fighting the war - ''this crazy chasing around in the villages with our massive firepower looking for body counts'' - but he did not find that the Communists were the popular good guys of American antiwar mythology.  Mr. Popkin's friends in Cambridge didn't want to hear about this.  He got back in his colleagues' good graces only after he was jailed in 1972 for refusing to testify before a special grand jury set up by the White House to find out who leaked the Pentagon Papers - the Pentagon's massive top-secret study of American involvement in Indochina from World War II to May 1968 - to The New York Times.  Douglas Pike, who throughout the war years was the resident expert in the United States Embassy in Saigon on the Vietnamese Communists, remembers a similar encounter with academic close-mindedness when he was on leave in Cambridge, Mass., in 1964 to write a book about the Vietcong. He had been invited to take part in an antiwar teach-in and found himself debating with a professor from the Harvard Dental School. ''The professor really didn't have his facts straight, so I asked him if he had ever been to Vietnam,'' Mr. Pike recalls.  '' 'No, that's not necessary,' the professor replied.  ''So I said, 'I've never been to dental school, but suppose I give you a root canal.' '' 'That's different,' he said.  ''I replied, 'How at Harvard, of all places, can you say knowledge is not important?' '' Mr. Pike has now retired from the Government and is the first director of the Indochina studies program at the University of California at Berkeley -an appointment that would have been unthinkable a decade ago at a campus that was in the vanguard of the antiwar movement. Mr. Pike has just completed a book on the North Vietnamese Army, which he wrote after discovering to his amazement that there was no comparable study. ''We never even knew the names of North Vietnam's generals or what their strategic thinking was,'' he says. ''It shows how ignorant and arrogant we were. We just assumed we would win.'' Mr. Pike's presence at Berkeley, where he is setting up a two-million-page archive on Indochina, is testament to Vietnam's having quietly made the transition from controversial public issue to history. as victory by the Communists inevitable? Since the end of the war, some of the best new scholarship has focused on the origins of the Communist movement in Vietnam and its reasons for success.  According to one school of thought, the Communists' early capture of the nationalist issue made their eventual victory a foregone conclusion. David G. Marr - a visiting professor at Cornell last fall who is now teaching at the Australian National University in Canberra - has shown how the Communists under Ho Chi Minh were able to build their strength in the 1930's and 40's by appealing to the centuriesold tradition of Vietnamese nationalism. Mr. Marr's two books, ''Vietnamese Anti-Colonialism, 1885-1925'' (1971) and ''Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920-1945'' (1981), are widely regarded as models of scholarly research.  In his view, ''the most important development of the entire conflict was the August 1945 revolution,'' when the Vietminh (the Communist-led guerrillas who had fought against the French) under Ho Chi Minh seized Hanoi and proclaimed an independent Vietnam before the French could re-establish their presence at the end of World War II.  ''Everything done after that by the French and the Americans was an attempt to turn back the clock, but they couldn't succeed,'' adds Mr. Marr, a former leading antiwar activist who is one of the few professors with military experience in Vietnam; he learned Vietnamese in the Marines. ''The outcome was predetermined. For the Communists were able to gain and hold legitimacy as a patriotic front.''  Says Professor Elliott of Pomona College, ''In 1945, the Vietminh clearly had overwhelming popular support - even the United States at first recognized this'' (an O.S.S. team had worked with Ho at the time). ''The Vietminh,'' he continues, ''won the war again in 1954 at Dien Bien Phu, and the Communists won it a third time in early 1965, before Johnson's commitment of U.S. ground forces.''  Mr. Popkin, among others, disagrees with this kind of deterministic interpretation. ''It's anti-intellectual; it doesn't allow for the normal process of change which occurs in history,'' he counters. ''If you argue that the Communists should have won the war in 1975 because they were the most popular group in 1945, does that mean that we should have a Democratic President today because Roosevelt was elected in 1944?'' Mr. Popkin himself is a liberal Democrat.  A very different view of the relations between Peking and Hanoi is also emerging. Early in the war, some Administration officials, like then Secretary of State Dean Rusk, contended that American commitment was necessary because North Vietnam was acting as an agent of Chinese Communist aggression. But if American diplomacy was able to salvage anything of value from the war, it was improved relations with China. The split between Hanoi and Peking grew out of centuries of enmity between the two countries and China's growing concern that the Vietnamese Communists were aligning themselves with the Soviet Union, China's erstwhile ally.  The break between North Vietnam and China has produced intriguing new evidence about another long-disputed topic: Who was responsible for failing to hold the 1956 elections, which, under the terms of the 1954 Geneva Conference that ended the French Indochina war, would have reunified North and South Vietnam?  In the past, many liberal antiwar critics blamed the Eisenhower Administration for encouraging President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam to ignore the elections. They argued that it was only because of the provision for the elections that Ho Chi Minh had agreed to the temporary division of Vietnam at Geneva, and that when the elections were not held, the Communists had little choice but to resume the war. But Vietnam's leaders now claim that the Chinese actually cut off military aid to them in 1954 to compel them to negotiate with the French and accept the division of the country. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's Prime Minister, told Mr. Karnow that he had said at the time: ''The Chinese have betrayed us.'' And several scholars have found records indicating that Zhou Enlai, China's Prime Minister, expected the separation of Vietnam to be long lasting and turned down Ho's request in 1956 for help in arranging the elections. This does not exonerate Washington for its role in discouraging the elections, says Professor Tai, but it shows that the United States was not alone.  Disclosures from Hanoi since 1975 are also making possible a reexamination of the Vietcong's growth. During the war, the most influential academic account of the origins of the National Liberation Front (N.L.F.), the formal name for the Vietcong, was in a book by two Cornell professors, George McT. Kahin and John W. Lewis, ''The United States in Vietnam.'' The authors argued forcefully that the Vietcong was ''Southern rooted.''  After the Geneva settlement, the authors contended, the Communists withdrew all their armed troops to the newly created North Vietnam, leaving behind only political cadres. Hanoi favored only political, not armed, resistance to Ngo Dinh Diem. But given the ''harshness and heavy-handedness of Diem's Government'' these Southerners ''lost patience with the Communist North'' and organized an insurgency led by the N.L.F. ''Hanoi, despite its reluctance, was then obliged to sanction the Southerners' actions.''  Professors Kahin and Lewis also asserted that there was no evidence that Hanoi encouraged ''militant tactics by the Southerners'' until as late as September 1960, or, contrary to United States Government claims, that Hanoi directed the formation of the N.L.F., which was a broad united front of Communist and non-Communist organizations.  Scholars still agree that most of the early Vietcong were Southerners and that there were factional disputes in Hanoi over how to pursue the insurgency during the 1950's. But a history published by the People's Army of Vietnam in 1980, titled ''The Anti-U.S.  Resistance War for National Salvation, 1954-1975: Military Events,'' contends that Hanoi played a large role in the development of the Vietcong. The history records, for example, that as early as 1957 ''cadres and men who remained behind'' in the South were able to form ''37 armed companies.''  Moreover, the history also admits that in a secret directive by the North Vietnamese Politburo in May 1959, Hanoi ordered its Southern supporters to switch from political action to armed struggle. To provide help for the new fighting, Hanoi established a special task force, code named Group 559, which set up infiltration routes and moved ''people, weapons and supplies'' through Laos into South Vietnam.  When the N.L.F. was proclaimed in December 1960, this official Communist history goes on, it was done at the order of the party in Hanoi, and the Front's program ''followed the line delineated by our party.'' These actions marked a critical turning point in the war, leading to the formation of bigger Vietcong units and an increase in attacks on South Vietnamese Government posts. It was this stepped-up activity that confronted President Kennedy when he took office in 1961 and led him to increase the number of American advisers in South Vietnam.  On another critical question, too, the Communists have been more candid since the end of the war: When did they begin sending regular North Vietnamese troops into the South?  Washington had long maintained that Hanoi started infiltrating its regular army units in the fall of 1964, prompting President Johnson's decision to begin bombing North Vietnam and then to dispatch American ground forces to South Vietnam a few months later.  Hanoi denied it had troops in the South until virtually the end of the war. When I visited North Vietnam in 1969, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said with a straight face that there were no Northern troops in the South. And antiwar activists dismissed State Department white papers on Northern infiltration. But when Mr. Karnow interviewed officials in Hanoi in 1981, they talked about enlarging the Ho Chi Minh Trail as early as 1964.  All this leads to another question raised by the new scholarship: Were Americans, grown suspicious of their own Government, too eager to accept as truth whatever the Vietnamese Communists said?  Throughout the war, there was heated debate over the degree of autonomy the N.L.F. enjoyed. Was it merely a puppet of North Vietnam, as many American officials insisted, or was it an independent organization, as the Communists claimed? The argument was important, because if the N.L.F. was independent, there might had been a chance for a negotiated settlement in the South.  Harrison E. Salisbury, who was among the first correspondents allowed to visit Hanoi in late 1966, made a strong case for the independence of the N.L.F. in his book ''Behind the Lines - Hanoi.'' The N.L.F., Mr. Salisbury wrote, ''had a government. It had a cabinet ... its own troops, its own generals, its own petty officials ... .''  From talks with an N.L.F. official in Hanoi, Mr. Salisbury said, he learned that the Front got its weapons directly from the Soviet Union and China and did not ''utilize Hanoi as a middleman.'' ''All military decisions in the South were the responsibility of the South.'' When Mr. Salisbury quizzed Prime Minister Dong on what would happen when the war was over, the Prime Minister assured him that the North would not annex the South: ''Reunification would only be by mutual agreement.'' Mr. Salisbury came away convinced that American officials who derided the N.L.F. were missing ''genuine possibilities'' for peace.  Asked recently if he might have been misled by the Communists, Mr.  Salisbury said, ''I'll stand by my reporting of the time.'' But, he added, he had been in Hanoi in early 1967 and ''by the time the war finally ended the situation was so vastly different that whatever had been said by myself, or Hanoi, or L.B.J. or anybody in the N.L.F.  really had very little validity.''  Since the war, some members of the N.L.F. have contended they themselves had been deceived by Hanoi. Writing last fall in The New York Review of Books, Truong Nhu Tang, the former Minister of Justice in the N.L.F.'s government and a French-educated ''independent socialist,'' indicated that he joined the Vietcong because he believed the Communists' promises that they would work for an autonomous, democratic South. At the end of the war, Hanoi annexed the South and the N.L.F. was disbanded.  At ''the simple farewell dinner'' held to disband the N.L.F. in 1976, Mr. Tang recalled, neither the party nor the Government bothered to send a representative. ''I was tragically wrong'' about the Communists, he wrote. ''The North Vietnamese Communists, survivors of protracted, blood-drenched campaigns against colonialism, interventionism and human oppression, became in their turn colonialists, interventionists and architects of one of the world's most rigid re-gimes.'' For the first time in Vietnam's history, Mr. Tang went on, people risked their lives to flee the country -something they had not done under the French or the Americans. Mr. Tang himself escaped by boat in 1979 and now lives in Paris.  American antiwar writers had envisioned a far happier future for Vietnam. One such writer was Frances FitzGerald, who wrote ''Fire in the Lake,'' a book that was both the most widely read and most highly acclaimed volume to come out of the war. (It won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the Bancroft Prize in history in 1973.) In the lyrical closing passage, Miss FitzGerald prophesied: ''Pressure is building towards one of those sudden historical shifts when 'individualism' and its attendant corruption gives way to the discipline of the revolutionary community. When this shift takes place ... it will simply mean that the moment has arrived for the narrow flame of revolution to cleanse the lake of Vietnamese society from the corruption and disorder of the American war.''  ''Fire in the Lake'' had its critics from the start. Mr. Marr, the authority on Vietnamese nationalism, pointed out in a scholarly review at the time of the book's publication that Miss FitzGerald did not know Vietnamese and charged that her depiction of Vietnamese national character was ''little short of disastrous.'' Mr. Popkin at San Diego suspects she was ''swept away by a love affair with the N.L.F.'' and that her belief that the Vietnamese would be happier under the Communists was ''racist and condescending.''  Miss FitzGerald rejects the charge that she was too romantic about the Communists. ''I'd stick with it,'' she says. ''I think it's written in a rather romantic style; one chooses rhetorical modes to make people understand certain things.'' As for Vietnam's terrible postwar troubles, she insists they are the result of the damage caused by the war, though she concedes the Communists have proved inept at running the economy.  What went wrong on the American side? Today, the one common note sounded by virtually all scholars is the need to start searching for the answer with President Truman's decision in 1945 to reverse Washington's earlier support for Ho Chi Minh. It was a choice made out of concern for bolstering France in Europe against the looming Soviet menace.  ''In class,'' says Robert A. Scalapino, director of the Institute of East Asian Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, ''I always stress that the history of American involvement in Vietnam was a series of decisions which cumulatively narrowed the choices for each succeeding President. No President was able to begin afresh with Vietnam.''  Professor Scalapino had a reputation as a conservative during the war, but Professor George Kahin, who was an outspoken critic of the war, and was until recently director of Cornell's Southeast Asia program, shares his view. In a new study of American involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967 -which he says is based on trips to Vietnam in the 60's and extensive original research in Government files - Professor Kahin claims he will prove that Washington actually began giving secret military aid to the French for Vietnam in the late 1940's.  ''This aid was officially shown in the records as going to Europe, but it was subverted to Vietnam by the French with U.S.  understanding,'' says Professor Kahin. Most history books date the origin of American involvement in Vietnam from a decision by President Truman's National Security Council in 1950 to provide military aid for the French war in Indochina.  Another key turning point whose significance was not appreciated at the time, historians now believe, was the 1963 coup against President Diem. Because the Kennedy Administration sanctioned the coup, Washington became morally and politically responsible for all the regimes that succeeded it, wrote Larry Berman in a new book, ''Planning a Tragedy: The Americanization of the War in Vietnam'' (1982).  Mr. Berman, an associate professor of political science at the University of California at Davis, is one of several writers now offering a more sympathetic portrait of Lyndon Johnson's role in the war. His book focuses on the decision-making process that led up to President Johnson's announcement on July 28, 1965, that he was increasing the number of American troops in Vietnam from 75,000 to 125,000, with additional forces to be deployed as necessary. This move is generally regarded as the critical decision that led to open-ended escalation.  Like a number of the new scholars, Mr. Berman was not trained in Vietnamese studies but is a specialist on the American Presidency.  His book is based on recently declassified White House documents he found while doing other research in the Johnson Library in Austin, Tex.  Nowhere in the documents was there evidence that President Johnson had a plan either for winning the war or for getting out. The reason for the absence of any coherent strategic plan is that President Johnson was trying to save his Great Society, not Vietnam. By an accident of history, in July 1965 both Medicare and the Civil Rights Act of 1965 were at crucial stages in Congressional committees; the Model Cities Act and the Higher Education Act were soon to follow. Lyndon Johnson was caught in a dilemma.  ''He didn't want to do anything to jeopardize them,'' Mr. Berman wrote. ''He really wanted to be the next face on Mount Rushmore.'' But the Communists were close to victory in Vietnam in early 1965, and President Johnson could not leave himself open to a charge by conservatives that he lost the war. On the other hand, if he took the steps the Pentagon urged - mobilizing the Reserves, for instance - Congressional liberals might have retaliated by withdrawing support for his Great Society programs.  ''So Johnson chose a middle course, to fight the war at the lowest possible cost, on the cheap,'' Mr. Berman went on. ''And he lied about what he was doing. He staged a debate to create a war climate, so that when he announced the number of troops was only going up from 75,000 to 125,000, he looked like a moderate. But he knew there would be 300,000 troops in Vietnam in 1966.''  ''We get a tragic historical figure who had to choose between guns and butter and couldn't,'' Mr. Berman continued. ''In the end, he neither settled the war nor got his Great Society, since as he fought in Vietnam, it drained the money needed for his domestic programs.''  Mr. Berman's thesis is similar to that in a book widely regarded by scholars as a seminal study of America's role in Vietnam - ''The Irony of Vietnam: The System Worked'' (1979), by Leslie H. Gelb, now a correspondent for The New York Times, and Richard K. Betts, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. For this work, the authors drew heavily on the Pentagon Papers, which provided critical new groundwork for analyzing Washington's decision-making process.  Mr. Gelb himself was director of the Pentagon Papers project within the Defense Department.  Mr. Gelb and Mr. Betts challenge the old liberal view put forward in books, such as David Halberstam's best seller ''The Best and the Brightest,'' that the United States stumbled into a quagmire in Vietnam through hubris and miscalculation.  Instead, they argue, Washington's planning machinery worked well, providing facts and options for the President. Rarely were the policy makers deluded that the odds for success in Vietnam were high. The trouble was that the Presidents, from Harry Truman to Richard Nixon, were afraid both to risk losing Vietnam to the Communists and to accept the decisive recommendations of their military advisers, which could lead to war with China or a domestic backlash. So they chose the in-between option, doing only what was necessary to stave off a Communist takeover at the time. This prevented a Communist victory till 1975. But their policies of gradual escalation played into the hands of the North Vietnamese, whose strategy was to drag out the war and make it increasingly costly to the United States.  In effect, the Presidents chose to ''nibble the bullet rather than bite it,'' Mr. Betts said at a conference on ''The U.S. Experience in Vietnam'' held last month at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.  Another factor in Washington's decision making, scholars now say, was that in the 1960's American political scientists were fascinated by theories of how the United States could effectively fight limited wars, as opposed to all-out conventional or nuclear wars. Theorists explored the question of how a nation could use force or the threat of force to compel its adversary to back down. Implicit in their theories was the idea that it was possible to signal your opponent by gradually increasing threats.  In another new study, ''When Governments Collide: Coercion and Diplomacy in the Vietnam Conflict, 1964-1968'' (1980), Wallace J.  Thies has shown how President Johnson and his advisers believed they could ''fine-tune'' the bombing and their peace offers to ''signal'' Hanoi to abandon its support for the Vietcong. But President Johnson's program suffered from two serious flaws, argues Mr. Thies, a professor of political science at Berkeley.  First of all, in a bureaucracy as large as the American Government, it proved impossible to ''orchestrate'' our bombing and diplomacy.  For example, the selection and timing of bombing targets often depended on extraneous factors like the weather; coordination between the Air Force and diplomats was difficult. As a result, what Washington intended to be a show of firmness often appeared to Hanoi to be vacillation or weakness.  Second, Mr. Thies contends, Washington had little understanding of politics in Hanoi and did not realize that the dominant group in the leadership, headed by Le Duan, the party First Secretary, had staked their careers on victory in the South after prolonged factional debate. By 1965, these men had already worked at infiltration and organizing the war in the South for many years. Like their American counterparts, they could not afford to be charged with losing South Vietnam.  Compared with the numerous new studies on the origins of American involvement in Vietnam, there has been little written on the war after 1966, and especially after the Tet offensive in 1968, largely because of the unavailability of materials. At the Johnson Library, relatively few documents have been declassified for the period after 1965, and given Federal budget cutbacks and the Reagan Administration's tightened procedures for declassification, library officials say further progress will be slow.  The situation is even worse for the Nixon years. There is no equivalent of the Pentagon Papers for Mr. Nixon's Presidency and there is no Nixon Presidential library yet. So scholars are heavily dependent on the memoirs of Mr. Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.  One of the best accounts, however, has been pieced together by George C. Herring, a professor of American history at the University of Kentucky and author of ''America's Longest War: The United States and Vietnam, 1950-1975'' (1979). Mr. Herring believes that President Nixon, like his predecessors, early on rejected calls for withdrawal - which he saw as dishonorable - and appeals for sharply increased escalation, feeling that he could solve a riddle that had baffled earlier Presidents.  Mr. Nixon's eventual strategy - Vietnamization -emerged on an improvised basis without a thorough policy review, Mr. Herring contends. In a paper written for the recent conference on Vietnam in Washington, Mr. Herring charged that during the first year of his Administration Mr. Nixon's policy may have been ''a classic case of the President appeasing various bureaucratic constituencies by giving them a bit of what they wanted.'' The military got to bomb North Vietnam's sanctuaries in Cambodia; Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird got a speeded-up pull-out of American troops from Vietnam to appease American opinion (with Vietnamization, the war was turned over to the South Vietnamese Army - ARVN -which was given new training and improved weapons) and the State Department got negotiations with Hanoi. But Mr. Herring concludes that President Nixon's plan did not provide either enough force to compel North Vietnam to negotiate or sufficient concessions to entice Hanoi to the table. Like the improvised strategies of the Johnson era, ''it offered only extended stalemate.''  That there could be a negotiated end to the fighting was, throughout the war, one of the most consistent beliefs of both policy makers in Washington and their critics. But Allan E. Goodman, a professor at Georgetown University, believes this was naive. In another of the new books, ''The Lost Peace: America's Search for a Negotiated Settlement of the Vietnam War'' (1978), he argues that ''The real obstacle to a negotiated settlement was probably not Washington's diplomacy,'' but ''as Hanoi maintained ever since its first direct conversation with Washington in 1962, the liberation of South Vietnam was an absolutely indispensable prerequisite'' for a settlement.  In other words, North Vietnam was not prepared to compromise.  Hanoi was further encouraged when American spokesmen assured it that American bombing of North Vietnam was not intended to destroy the country. The North Vietnamese were aware that the longer the war went on the more painful it was for the United States. So Hanoi waited for Washington to make the concessions.  In the end, this was what happened. ''Nearly every time Washington made a negotiating offer to Hanoi, the U.S. terms softened,'' Mr.  Goodman wrote, until finally, in the Paris talks in 1972, Mr.  Kissinger agreed that the United States would withdraw from Vietnam without obtaining a comparable pledge from Hanoi.  Without access to more documents from the period, it is impossible to judge if President Nixon and Mr. Kissinger believed the Paris accords gave South Vietnam a real chance to survive or whether they felt the agreement was merely a face-saving ''decent interval'' during which the United States could disentangle itself from Vietnam. Either way, America's exit from Vietnam proved as stumbling as its entry.  A conundrum that has baffled a generation of American military officers is this: The Army won every battle it fought against the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese, inflicting terrible losses on them. Yet Hanoi emerged the victor. When Col. Harry G. Summers Jr.  was in Hanoi in 1975 as part of the American military delegation overseeing the Peace Accords, he mentioned to a North Vietnamese officer that the Communists had never defeated the Americans on the battlefield. The North Vietnamese colonel replied: ''That may be so, but it is also irrelevant.''  In the years since, Colonel Summers, an instructor at the Army War College at Carlisle, Pa., has found that, despite the welter of writing about Vietnam, few scholars have re-examined the military side of the war. To try to fill this void, Colonel Summers, who fought in Korea and served two tours in Vietnam, has turned out one of the most thoughtful and provocative military studies of the war, titled ''On Strategy: A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War'' (1982).  Unlike some senior American commanders, Colonel Summers does not blame the politicians, the protesters or the press for America's defeat. Instead, he finds flaws in the military's own approach. Most important, the Army simply lacked a strategy - an unforgivable sin for a soldier.  Instead of having a strategy, Colonel Summers argues, military and policy planners got carried away by the mystique of fighting a counterinsurgency war. In Colonel Summers's view, North Vietnam was the real opponent, but because Hanoi hid its involvement behind a smokescreen of guerrillas, the United States got tied down in fighting those insurgents. ''We were like a bull charging the toreador's cape,'' he comments.  The result was that the Army got caught up in General Westmoreland's search-and-destroy operations, which cost the lives of many American soldiers, outraged public opinion and did not deal with the real source of Communist strength - North Vietnam. Because of their helicopters and firepower, American forces may have had the tactical initiative, but they confused that with the strategic initiative, which Hanoi had all along.  Operating from their sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia, the Communists controlled the tempo of the fighting, and no matter how many Communists the Americans killed, success depended on the number of men Hanoi started down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In this war of attrition, North Vietnam could not be beaten as long as it was willing to pay the price.  Where most critics of American military policy in Vietnam have argued that the United States tried to fight a guerrilla war using conventional tactics, Colonel Summers contends - in one of his most controversial points -that it had always been a conventional war. The French in Indochina fought against a guerrilla army, he admits, but Hanoi's use of the Vietcong as proxies obfuscated the issue.  The United States could have had a strategy, Colonel Summers maintains. Since our goal was much the same as it had been in Korea, he believes, to stop the expansion of a Communist state, we could have pursued a Korean solution - cutting off North Vietnam from the South.  Quoting a plan first advanced by retired Gen. Bruce Palmer Jr., a former deputy commander of the American Army in Vietnam, Colonel Summers suggests that, with an expanded naval blockade, the army should have driven across the Demilitarized Zone between the two Vietnams and then cut through Laos to the Thai border, setting up defensive positions.  ''This would have had a number of advantages,'' says Colonel Summers. It would have required far fewer American troops. We could have fought on the defensive, making maximum use of our best asset, our firepower, and reducing our casualties. And it would have left rooting out the guerrillas to the South Vietnamese Army, which was best equipped to do it, and would have kept Americans out of the villages.  Colonel Summers rejects the argument that this strategy would have violated the neutrality of Laos and Cambodia, which he thinks was a fiction. ''The North Vietnamese never made a secret they were fighting an Indochina war,'' he says, and, in fact, the new North Vietnamese history of the war admits that Hanoi had ''volunteers'' in Laos as early as 1959. ''Neutrality was a myth we inflicted on ourselves,'' says Colonel Summers. He also quotes from the Hague Convention of 1907: ''A neutral country has the obligation not to allow its territory to be used by a belligerent. If the neutral country is unwilling or unable to prevent this, the other belligerent has the right to take appropriate counteraction.''  Colonel Summers also contends that the generals should have insisted that President Johnson get a Congressional declaration of war before committing American troops to Vietnam. President Johnson's attempt to fight the war on the cheap, without telling the public about its real costs, led to the credibility gap and helped spread the antiwar movement.  It was this lack of popular support for the war which also fostered the idea that the Vietnam War was more immoral than other wars, Colonel Summers believes. ''People talk about the picture of the little girl running down the road who got napalmed,'' he says. ''But tens of thousands of little girls got incinerated in the fire-bomb raids on Dresden and Tokyo in World War II and we don't remember. The difference is we believed World War II was legitimate.''  To underscore this point, Colonel Summers quotes from an article by General Weyand, the last American commander in Vietnam: ''As military professionals we must speak out, we must counsel our political leaders and alert the American public that there is no such thing as a 'splendid little war.' ... War is death and destruction. The American way of war is particularly violent, deadly and dreadful. We believe in using 'things' - artillery, bombs, massive firepower -in order to conserve our soldiers' lives. ... The Army must make the price of involvement clear before we get involved, so that America can weigh the probable costs of involvement against the dangers of noninvolvement. For there are worse things than war.''  Like a number of officers, Colonel Summers raises the question of why some members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not resign in protest when they sensed the lack of a coherent strategy and President Johnson's attempt to fight the war with limited means.  At the recent conference on Vietnam in Washington, retired Brig.  Gen. Edwin H. Simmons, the director of Marine Corps History and Museums, said that he had asked some of the Chiefs the question himself. ''The inevitable answer is: They could work better from within,'' said General Simmons, who served two tours in Vietnam with the Marines. It was one of the distortions of the Vietnam War, he said, that some officers allowed the honored principle of civilian control of the military to come to mean civilian leadership and management of the military on the combat level in the field. Officers at all levels of command ''used civilian control as an exoneration from moral responsibility,'' he charged.  General Simmons is currently supervising a 10-volume official history of the Marines in Vietnam, one of a series of such projects by each of the armed services. Taken together, they consti-tute the most ambitious and detailed work now being done on the war. The largest in scope is a planned 20-volume series by the Army's Center of Military History in Washington.  The Army's earlier 80-volume history of World War II has received high marks from scholars for its integrity. But Vincent H. Demma -one of 10 historians selected to help write the Vietnam volumes and who has been working on the project since the mid-1960's - admits that victory is easier to record than defeat. Moreover, the writers face another problem, a wealth of documentation left over from a conflict that was not only the first television war, but also the first Xerox and computer war. In Suitland, Md., outside Washington, in a warehouse the size of three football fields, repose more than 60,000 cubic feet of records shipped home by the Army, mostly uncatalogued.  Mr. Demma hopes this material and other archives, including taperecorded interviews with officers as they left Vietnam, will someday furnish what is now missing - ''an understanding of the war from the foxhole up rather than from the policy makers down.'' Aside from some novels by ex-soldiers, very little has been written on the actual conduct of the war, says Mr. Demma. But he feels that the special access he and his fellow authors have to still-classified material, including that in the Presidential libraries and other Government organizations like the Central Intelligence Agency, should eventually provide a more accurate picture of Vietnam.  Despite all the blunders, a number of historians and military specialists are coming to conclude that the American military effort in Vietnam was more successful than was recognized at the time. When Mr. Popkin, for instance, returned to Vietnam in 1969 and 1970 to check on the villages he had studied in 1966, he was surprised to find that the balance of power in the countryside had shifted dramatically in the South Vietnamese Government's favor. This was, in part, the result of the huge Communist mistake in the 1968 Tet offensive, when the best Vietcong units, which had long preserved their strength by operating clandestinely, exposed themselves in open attacks. They were decimated by American and South Vietnamese counterat-tacks. American officials estimated the Communists lost 40,000 killed in the Tet fighting, the bulk of them Southern guerrillas rather than North Vietnamese.  Mr. Tang, the former N.L.F. Minister of Justice, has described Tet as ''catastrophic''; he calculated the Vietcong lost half their forces and new recruits could not be found lo-cally to replace them.  As a result, by the early 70's, 90 percent of the fighting was being done by North Vietnamese troops and the war turned more and more into a conventional conflict between North and South. (Mr. Pike and some other specialists have speculated that Hanoi may have deliberately allowed the Vietcong to be massacred at Tet to assure North Vietnam's control over the Communist movement in the South, much as the advancing Russian Army stood by during the Warsaw uprising in 1944.)  But at the time, most Americans, shocked by the daring Vietcong attack on the United States Embassy in Saigon and the weeks of street fighting in Hue, felt Tet was a defeat for the United States. It led to President Johnson's announcement that he would not run again, his proclamation of a bombing halt over North Vietnam and his decision to stop the escalation of American ground forces. For most Americans, Tet was the beginning of the end of our involvement.  Even those American officials and journalists who claimed in 1968 that Tet was a military defeat for the Communists still tended to credit Hanoi with a masterful strategy -sacrificing troops to deal Washington a psychological blow. But that view, too, was wrong.  When he was in Vietnam for his television series, Mr. Karnow interviewed Tran Do, one of the Communist generals in charge of the Tet attacks. The general denied that Tet was designed to have a political impact in the United States; instead, he said, the Communists fully believed there would be popular uprisings and that they could ''annihilate the U.S. and Saigon troops.'' The political impact ''was an accidental byproduct,'' the general said. Major popular uprisings never took place.  Tet, in fact, ''totally destroyed the idea of the inevitability of an N.L.F. victory in the villages,'' says Mr. Popkin. ''When the villagers saw the stacks of Vietcong bodies in Saigon on their local TV sets, they rushed to get their sons into local defense forces'' so that they would not be drafted by the Vietcong.  At the same time, the sheer weight of American military spending and aid programs began to be felt. Many peasants rushed to work for the Americans, building roads, bridges, runways and schools.  Typically, Mr. Popkin found, in the 18 villages he studied, the peasants used their earnings to buy a baby piglet, raised it, sold it, and with the profits invested in a diesel water pump to irrigate their rice fields. With these mechanized pumps the farmers in the Mekong Delta could at last get two rice crops a year, and the standard of living in the countryside started to take off.  In the early and mid-1960's, the peasants had had an economic incentive to live in a ''liberated'' or Communist village, Mr.  Popkin found, because the Vietcong taxes were lower than the rent peasants had to pay landlords in Government-held areas. But by the time of Tet, the incentive was reversed. As the Vietcong's military situation grew more desperate, their taxes increased. And now that the peasants had pigs, chickens and rice they could sell in Government markets, they got angry when the Communists cut a road.  ''The Vietcong may have been more honest than the Government, but they couldn't compete with water pumps, chemical fertilizer and Hondas,'' says Mr. Popkin. He has developed some of his ideas about the farmers' material interests in a book widely used in college courses, titled ''The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam'' (1979).  In the light of Hanoi's postwar revelations, specialists are revising even their views of the Phoenix program, the scheme sponsored by the C.I.A. to destroy the Vietcong apparatus in the villages by arresting or killing local Communist cadres. ''The conven tional liberal wisdom at the time was that it was a terrible thing,'' says Mr. Karnow. ''It killed people indiscriminately and was subject to corruption by the South Vietnamese who turned in people for the reward money. But the people I talked to on my trip in Vietnam said it had wiped out many Southern cadres and helped cripple the N.L.F.''  Overall, by 1970 nearly 90 percent of the countryside was officially ''pacified,'' compared with only 33 percent in 1965, a crude though significant index of change.  Professor Herring at the University of Kentucky has suggested that ''the ultimate irony'' of the war may be that the American position in South Vietnam was stronger at the end of 1972, just before the Paris peace agreement, than at any previous point in the war. Mr.  Popkin concurs and adds, ''There's no doubt that if Nixon had kept up U.S. aid after 1973, South Vietnam might have survived.'' But that is one of the great historical ifs. American patience had run out.  What, then, went wrong after the Paris accords? Why did South Vietnam collapse in 1975 under a North Vietnamese attack that was designed only to prepare for a bigger, final offensive in 1976?  (According to Douglas Pike, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the North Vietnamese commander, was so startled by the rapidity of the South Vietnamese retreat that he cautioned his officers in the field by radio against falling into a trap.)  Clearly one problem was the poor leadership and corruption that bedeviled the Saigon Government throughout the war. But Professor Tai believes that in fairness we should recognize that Saigon faced problems Hanoi did not have. North Vietnam could forge a more disciplined state because its society was more homogeneous than that of the South. Most anti-Communists in the North moved to the South in 1954, and the North never had to deal with the South's fractious babble of sects like the Buddhists, the Hoa Hao and the Cao Dai.  Mrs. Tai also believes that the American peace movement misunderstood how the South Vietnamese people felt. ''There were many people like me who did not support Thieu but who didn't like the Communists either,'' she says. Indeed, she represented the kind of third force that American officials in Saigon hoped would somehow emerge. ''I didn't think a Communist victory would lead to any improvement for the middle class, or even for the peasants, in whose name the revolution was fought,'' she says. In 1977, her father, despite his Communist background, was arrested for protesting the human-rights situation in Vietnam; he died of starvation in a ''reeducation'' camp in 1981.  On the basis of his village interviews, Mr. Popkin also came to a conclusion that the American left overrated the popularity of the Communists. With his training in polling, Mr. Popkin noticed a number of ''unobtrusive indicators.'' ''When you want to know what radio stations people are listening to,'' he says, ''you don't ask them. You just look in their cars at a parking lot to see where the dials are set.''  One sign was that while many South Vietnamese soldiers deserted to go home -just as Union troops did in the American Civil War - they did not defect in large units to the Communists. This was in sharp contrast to China, where during the 1940's whole Nationalist divisions defected to Mao Zedong's Communist guerrillas. Mr. Popkin noted, too, that in the Tet offensive, when the Communists' surprise attacks trapped many Americans in Vietnamese residential areas, very few were betrayed to the Communists.  ''It tells you,'' says Mr. Popkin, ''that the problem in Vietnam was not too much support for the Communists, or lack of support for the Saigon Government. It was just a rotten government. You can't fight something with nothing.''  Another reason for Saigon's collapse in 1975, South Vietnamese and American officials have long insisted, was the cutback in American aid mandated by a Congress which lost interest in the war after the G.I.'s had left in 1973.  American military aid to South Vietnam and Laos dropped from about $2.5 billion in 1973 to $1.6 billion in 1974 and then plunged further to a projected $700 million in 1975, half of it covering shipping costs. When Hanoi's attack came, South Vietnam's armed forces were receiving only 2 percent of the funds and supplies American soldiers had gotten in 1968 or 1969, according to retired Maj. Gen. John E.  Murray, the chief American military administrator in Saigon in 1974.  In other words, said Gen. Van Tien Dung, North Vietnam's field commander, in his memoir on the final offensive, the Thieu regime was compelled ''to fight a poor man's war,'' a fact that Hanoi took carefully into account.  ''You know what Napoleon said,'' General Murray pointed out at the conference on Vietnam in Washington. ''God is on the side of the biggest battalions. And right about then, God was on the side of the Communists. They were bigger, they were stronger. That's why ARVN lost the war.''  But there was something else at work. The huge American investment in Vietnam, Mr. Karnow points out, had ''lulled the South Vietnamese into believing that the United States would never leave. Nobody in his right mind would spend billions to build the complex at Cam Ranh Bay and then depart. The Americans must be crazy. They were crazy.  The South Vietnamese were left holding the bag.''  Professor Elliott at Pomona College thinks this dependence is the key to understanding the war. ''It seems to me,'' he says, ''that the Communists had an appeal that prevented the South Vietnamese from coalescing around a non-Communist government. Because the Saigon regimes were always dependent on the United States, in the eyes of the nationalistic Vietnamese, this created a moral paralysis.'' Mr.  Elliott says he could see this in interviews he conducted with Vietcong defectors in the Mekong Delta during the war. ''However much they had come to dislike the Communists, they acknowledged the Front had a moral appeal which undermined the Government.'' So the South Vietnamese faced an insoluble contradiction. ''They couldn't win without us, but they couldn't win with us either.'' One group whose influence on Vietnam has been downgraded by the new scholars is the antiwar movement. From studying public-opinion polls, John E. Mueller, a professor of political science at the University of Rochester, has found that the Vietnam War was no more unpopular than the Korean War - until American casualties in Vietnam surpassed those in Korea. That line was crossed, coincidentally, during the Tet offensive. Professor Mueller believes that the tactics of some of the protesters, with flag burnings and anti-American slogans, actually undercut their credibility with the public. ''The antiwar movement picked up negative popularity ratings in an almost unprecedented degree,'' he says.  Washington was certainly aware of the protests, says Mr. Mueller, who has written about the subject in ''War, Presidents and Public Opinion'' (1973). But the Johnson Administration's about-faces in 1968 - stopping the bombing of North Vietnam and ending our troop escalation -had more to do with disaffection within the Government itself over how badly the war was going and its high costs, he asserts.  Another little-known reason for the Government's shift in 1968, Mr. Mueller has found, is that within the Government ''the value of saving Vietnam from Communism had gone down since we got committed in 1965.'' China, formerly seen as a threat, had become engulfed in the Cultural Revolution, and Indonesia, which had appeared on the brink of a Communist takeover, massacred its Communist Party.  Mr. Mueller also points out that President Johnson's near defeat by Senator Eugene McCarthy in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, which influenced President Johnson's decision not to run again, was caused more by angry hawks than by doves. At the ballot box, anti-Johnson hawks outnumbered anti-Johnson doves by 3 to 2.  The protesters did have an effect on the Presidential elections.  Their attacks on Vice President Humphrey ''probably gave Nixon the slim margin of votes necessary to win in 1968,'' says Mr. Mueller.  Then, in 1972, with the Democratic convention controlled by opponents of the war, ''they picked George McGovern, arguably the worst choice as a Democratic candidate in modern times.''  But Mr. Mueller discounts the charge by hawks that the protest movement strengthened Hanoi's resolve and helped the United States lose Vietnam. ''Hanoi may have been encouraged by the peace movement,'' he says, ''but the North Vietnamese were fanatics who would have continued the war for as long as necessary to win.'' In another of his studies, Mr. Mueller estimated that the North Vietnamese and Vietcong suffered 500,000 to 600,000 battle deaths - about 2.5 percent to 3 percent of their prewar population. By comparison, the United States lost only three-tenths of 1 percent of its population in battle during World War II, and the Japanese, whom Americans regarded as true fanatics, 1.4 percent. ''The crucial mistake the U.S. made was to underestimate how much punishment North Vietnam would take,'' he says.  Are there lessons Americans can learn from Vietnam? The question is important, because it was one of the supposed lessons of World War II - not to appease aggression - that helped get the United States into Vietnam. There is little consensus, however, on what can be gleaned from Vietnam. James C. Thomson Jr., curator at the Nieman Foundation at Harvard, who was a member of President Johnson's National Security Council staff and who opposed American involvement in Vietnam, has proposed that the ''central lesson'' is that we should never again ''take on the job of trying to defeat a nationalist anticolonial movement under indigenous Communist control in former French Indochina.'' This is, notes Mr. Thomson wryly, ''a lesson of less than universal significance.''  But Robert E. Osgood, a professor of American foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, believes Americans have learned the danger of intervening in a revolutionary war where the local government is weak. In such cases, the United States must commit so many troops to compensate for the regime's shortcomings that it ends up only undermining the government. El Salvador is an example, says Professor Osgood, who was one of the most important theorists on limited war in the 1960's.  ''But this is not necessarily a lesson you can apply in every revolutionary war,'' he adds. In the Philippines after World War II, American aid provided a critical ''missing component'' that stopped a Communist insurgency. So to exclude American intervention in every contingency ''is probably overdrawing the lesson,'' he says.  The problem, in Professor Osgood's view, is that there are many variables for Washington to ponder: the strength of the local regime, the resolve of its adversary, the possibilities for getting out if American intervention proves unsuccessful.  The real issue is the magnitude of American interests and the threat to them. ''That was a mistake in Vietnam -our greatly inflated rhetoric about falling dominoes turned out to be wrong,'' Professor Osgood points out. But American foreign policy is still wedded to containment, and questions may arise again about combating a Communist-led revolution or takeover in the Middle East or Central America, he notes.  If that prospect arises, says Mr. Betts, we have not really learned what to do except that the United States can fight only if the war is kept short. ''We know more now,'' he believes, but we do not know how to avoid a disastrous war except at the possible price that Presidents Kennedy and Johnson foresaw -disastrous acceptance of defeat.  Another lesson is the need for better leadership, says Ernest R.  May, a professor of history at Harvard. At the Washington conference on Vietnam, he recalled that in 1948 George C. Marshall, then Secretary of State, opposed a military proposal to send 10,000 American advisers to aid the Chinese Nationalists because it involved a commitment of uncertain magnitude and indefinite duration. ''What we did not have in 1965 was an individual of Marshall's stature and independent judgment,'' Mr. May said.  There are also lessons for small states that might look to the United States for help. At the Washington meeting, Bui Diem, who served as South Vietnam's Ambassador to the United States, issued a warning. ''My advice to small nations considering U.S. aid is that they should be wary of the United States,'' he said. ''They should pay very close attention to the American domestic political system, because U.S. policies can change quickly. We small nations can end up losing higher stakes than the United States itself because, for the American, you can turn the page and say, 'Well, it is an unhappy chapter for U.S. history.' But that is not the same now for the South Vietnamese.''  And there are lessons for the military. The most important, Colonel Summers believes, is that ''we must relearn that public support is critical to American military strategy.'' To make his point, Colonel Summers quotes from General Weyand, the man who welcomed the P.O.W.'s to Saigon in 1973. ''The American Army really is a people's army in the sense that it belongs to the American people,'' the general said. ''When the American people lose their commitment, it is futile to try to keep the Army committed. In the final analysis, the American Army is not so much an arm of the executive branch as it is an arm of the American people.'' Up at the blackboard, a teaching assistant had chalked in the names to be discussed in the day's lecture at the University of Iowa. There, in large letters, were Robert McNamara, and McGeorge Bundy, and Ngo Dinh Diem and the Green Berets.  Fifteen years ago, when Vietnam first invaded the American campus, they would all have been household words, objects of heated debate and perhaps derision. But to the 300 students in the large classroom, they were like something from an arcane novel, to be carefully copied down.  ''For the students, history begins about 1980,'' says Stephen Vlastos, a professor of history at the University of Iowa who is in charge of the course, ''The Vietnam War in Historical Perspective.'' Indeed, most of them were not even born at the time of the Americansupported coup against President Diem. Katharyn Bine, a freshman from Beaman, Iowa, a farming town of 209 people, was only 1 year old when Lyndon Johnson dispatched the first American ground forces to Vietnam in 1965. Before taking the course, she had heard the name Ho Chi Minh, but she had not known who Diem or McNamara or Bundy was.  Yet Miss Bine and the course at Iowa represent another development - a quiet revival of interest in Vietnam on campus 10 years after the last American troops were withdrawn. More than two dozen colleges this year are offering courses on the war or Vietnamese history, ranging from Harvard to Thomas More College in northern Kentucky.  Almost all the classes have drawn more students than their professors expected.  What are the students learning? It seems to depend on the professor, his own view of Vietnam and the books he assigns. Not surprisingly, a majority of the professors were strongly influenced by the antiwar movement. Mr. Vlastos, for instance, helped organize a demonstration against President Johnson while he was an undergraduate at Princeton in 1966. He is candid about his antiwar sentiments.  ''It's the reason I'm teaching the course,'' he says. ''At the beginning of the course, I told the students I believe the war was a terrible mistake.''  Professor Vlastos is also an example of another heritage of academic feeling about the war. Distaste for the war was so widespread that few academics specialized in Vietnam, and so today most of the new courses on Vietnam are being taught by professors who were trained in subjects like American history or Chinese studies.  Mr. Vlastos got his Ph.D. from Berkeley in Japanese history.  Even more striking, though nearly three million Americans served in Vietnam, very few of the professors teaching about Vietnam were ever there. At a conference last fall on ''Vietnam and the Classroom'' in Kentucky, sponsored by the Kentucky Association of Teachers of History, only one of the 11 speakers and only three of the 75 participating teachers had been in Vietnam.  ''If we were talking about World War II, this room would be full of veterans,'' observed T. Wayne Beasley, a professor at Murray State University in western Kentucky. But, Mr. Beasley complained, ''with Vietnam you people who are teaching about it are the same people who were protesting it as students in the 1960's.''  At the Newark campus of Rutgers University, H. Bruce Franklin is worried about a different problem. Mr. Franklin, a professor of English, says he was distressed when he polled the students in his course, ''America and Vietnam,'' and found the majority believed the United States lost the war because ''we didn't try hard enough.'' ''This illusion has to be dispelled immediately,'' Mr. Franklin adds. So he stresses the damage the United States did to Vietnam, like bombing it between 1964 and 1969 with more than nine times the tonnage of high explosives dropped in the entire Pacific theater during World War II. Mr. Franklin rejects a suggestion that such figures may be misleading because many of the bombs dropped on Vietnam landed in the jungle, not on civilian villages.  Despite the prevalence of antiwar views among most professors, some teachers have begun to incorporate the more complex and dispassionate new scholarship into their curriculum. One of the most imaginative new classes is at the University of Louisville, taught by an unlikely duo: a hawkish former artillery officer in Vietnam, Richard N.  Pfeiffer, and a confirmed antiwar activist with a Ph.D. in East Asian history, Andrea McElderry. Miss McElderry is an associate professor of history; Mr. Pfeiffer is a vice president of an industrial-supply company who teaches in his spare time.  ''The idea of the class is to give the students as many different points of view as we can about the war, because we don't think anyone has solved Vietnam,'' says Miss McElderry. ''We don't let our students say things like 'This side won the war.' ''  To broaden the course, the two teachers invite guest speakers from the Louisville area, including a former Green Beret, a retired Army general, a one-time high official in the Saigon Government, a peacemovement activist and a psychiatrist from a Veterans' Administration hospital who treats troubled veterans.  Miss McElderry feels the unusual chemistry between her and Mr.  Pfeiffer has been beneficial. ''Until I met Richard, I was sure of my views about Vietnam. He has made me rethink them, and I have influenced him, too. I couldn't have taught the course the same way with my Asian specialist colleagues, because all of them were getting 2-S student deferments during Vietnam.'' - F.B.

A Vietnamese press agency report Friday said the information had ''just been gathered from a number of localities in northern Vietnam.''  The Vietnamese reportedly told the official American team they had been able to obtain some of the remains and identification tags and other information on the dead Americans and had asked the United States delegation to provide files on the 12 cases so more positive identification could be made.  The American delegation was headed by Lieut. Col. Joseph Harvey, chief of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center, a Hawaii-based unit.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",March 13 1983 ,3
"    The death toll from the terrorist attack on United States marines in Beirut is far greater than in any similar incident in Vietnam.  In fact, on only one day in the entire Vietnam War did the nationwide total of American casualties exceed the 216 American marines, sailors and soldiers reported killed so far in Beirut on Sunday, according to Defense Department records. An estimated 20 to 30 bodies were reported still buried under the rubble in Beirut.  The largest number of Americans killed on a single day in Vietnam occurred Jan. 31, 1968, at the start of the Communists' nationwide Tet offensive, when 246 Americans died. On Feb. 23, 1969, 208 Americans died in action in Vietnam.  But none of the Vietcong terrorist incidents, some of which contributed to the Johnson Administration's decision to increase American intervention in Vietnam, were on the scale of the Beirut attack.  American Compound Destroyed  In perhaps the most politically significant terrorist incident in Vietnam, Vietcong guerrillas infiltrated and blew up a United States compound at Pleiku in the central highlands in the early morning of Feb. 7, 1965. Nine American servicemen were killed and 107 were wounded in the attack and 10 aircraft were destroyed.  McGeorge Bundy, President Johnson's national security adviser, was visiting Saigon at the time and used the attack to urge the President to begin bombing North Vietnam. American bombing raids, from a carrier in the South China Sea, followed within hours.  The Johnson Administration and United States officials in Saigon had earlier been angered when two Vietcong saboteurs blew up the Brinks Hotel in Saigon on Christmas Eve, 1964. Two Americans were killed and 58 wounded in that incident.  In a new book, ''Vietnam: A History,'' by Stanley Karnow, the author tells of interviewing one of the saboteurs during a 1981 visit to Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City. The former guerrilla, Thanh Xuan, said he had been given his orders by an intermediary the month before.  Mingled With Soldiers  The two men reconnoitered the target, mixing easily with the crowds that filled the busy street outside, and noting that South Vietnamese officers mingled freely with the Americans. After buying South Vietnamese uniforms on the black market, Mr. Xuan said, his comrade disguised himself as a South Vietnamese army major, while Mr. Xuan dressed as his chauffeur. They filled the trunk of their car with explosives.  Then, on the afternoon of Dec. 24, in Mr. Karnow's account, the ''major'' drove up to the Brinks Hotel and asked to see an American colonel that Communist intelligence knew had left Vietnam.  After telling a desk clerk and a policeman they would wait for the colonel to return, the two men calmly walked to a nearby cafe and awaited the powerful explosion.  In June 1965, Vietcong terrorists also planted a mine at a floating restaurant in Saigon, killing 44 people, including 12 Americans.  But after the Tet offensive in 1968 the Vietcong were severely weakened and the number of terrorist attacks in the cities fell off sharply.

"    Craig R. Whitney, an assistant managing editor of The New York Times, was a foreign correspondent from 1971 to 1980, stationed in Saigon, Bonn and Moscow. He was in Vietnam from 1971 to 1973.   S OUR THAI AIRWAYS jet came in for a landing at Hanoi, skimming bomb craters that had become circular rice paddies, I felt again the cold fear that had been a fairly constant companion during my two years as a war correspondent in Vietnam. Now, it was not so much fear of danger as fear of the unknown, of what I might learn about the fate of the people since American troops left after the defeat of South Vietnam almost 10 years ago and the country was reunified under Communist rule.  This was my first trip to Hanoi, and I had no idea how I would be received. My discomfort rose at the airport's passport-control booth, where uniformed guards eyed my American passport with what seemed to be special suspicion and hostility.  But I was wrong. I was just another foreigner.  And, as I was vividly reminded a few days later during a tour of the military museum in Hanoi, the Vietnamese are wary of foreigners.  The museum's display begins with ancient Vietnamese insurrections against China - the Trung sisters' rebellion in the first century A.D. is not even the earliest - and continues through several rooms filled with pictures of French colonizers and the battles that defeated them in 1954, through the struggles with Ngo Dinh Diem and Lyndon Johnson and a succession of American generals in charge of the American war effort, up to one of the museum's most popular photos - a massive American pilot being taken prisoner by a tiny Vietnamese militiawoman. But the museum display does not end with the diorama showing the evacuation of the American Embassy on the last day of April 1975. An entire hall is devoted to the attacks by Pol Pot's forces along the Cambodian border with Vietnam in late l978, the subsequent invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam that resulted in the overthrow of Pol Pot, followed by the invasion of Vietnam by the Chinese in 1979, which was intended to punish the Vietnamese for their invasion of Cambodia.  Here was graphic evidence that the American war, the defeat we are now finally examining in an outpouring of books and television documentaries, re-experiencing in movies, novels and memoirs, is an interlude in Vietnamese history, an epic, tragic interlude that cost more than a million Vietnamese lives and 58,000 American ones, but an interlude nonetheless. The Vietnam War is over for us; it continues, for the Vietnamese, with China.  My fear of being singled out was thus unfounded, and I encountered not hostility but wary curiosity in Hanoi as well as in the cities and battlefields I had lived in and covered during the war - Quang Tri, Hue, Dong Ha, Da Nang, Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City).  What I found was a country with all the trappings and restrictive laws of a Communist police state, but without its ruthless efficiency. Vietnam is a backward, contradictory, impoverished country that is 30 years behind the economic boom and the traffic jams of Hong Kong and Bangkok, exhausted not so much by the war as by the problems caused by peace. Its leaders seem overwhelmed by problems of feeding 54 million people without the war's great infusions of foreign aid and sup   Page 26 plies; problems of developing a peacetime economy when the per capita income is only $150 a year; problems of dealing with social and political gaps that had grown up between North and South during more than 20 years of partition, from 1954 to 1976; problems of continuing dependence on foreigners - now the Russians.  According to Western diplomats in Hanoi, there are about 6,000 Russians scattered around the country, supervising projects and advising on an estimated $1 billion in aid. I was often mistaken for a Russian in the north, where this usually meant a reserved smile and a salutation; this mistake was made less often in the south, where being misidentified as a Russian sometimes meant being spat upon.  Whatever nationality I was taken for, however, I was officially off-limits for the Vietnamese. The people are forbidden to talk to any foreigner, and so I could not visit personal friends, as I had hoped to do - indeed, as I had hoped beyond all else to do when I first applied to the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry to make the trip in April.  When my visa was finally granted, toward the end of August, it was understood that I would put myself in the hands of the Communist authorities, who would provide drivers and a translator for my two-week stay. I could ask to see war veterans, village chiefs, hospitals, schools, churches and temples. I could ask to see ordinary people, scholars and high-ranking officials: Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, the Defense Minister, Van Tien Dung; of these, only Mr. Thach acceded to my wish, promising to see me in New York when he came for the United Nations General Assembly. I could ask how the people who had suffered from the American bombing felt about us now; I could ask people who had been on the losing side how they were being treated by the Communists now and hope to know whether they were telling me the truth. I  Page 27 could ask to visit one of the ''re-education camps,'' where some 10,000 former South Vietnamese officials are still held (a request not granted) and one of the new economic zones created to provide jobs in the countryside. And I could ask to talk to people who were trying to leave the country in order to find out why so many had already left or wanted to.  I could try, in other words, to answer those questions which had gnawed at me since Vietnam was lost to us in 1975: to see what had become of the country and the people I had come to know so well but lost touch with, as all Americans had.       HE ROAD TO HANOI FROM THE AIRport crosses the Red River on what the French called the Paul Doumer Bridge - a bottleneck rail and road span whose black iron girders, cast in Paris between 1899 and 1902, kept supplies coming in from China through all the years of the war despite countless American bomb attacks. The bridge became a kind of monument to Vietnamese persistence against all odds. It is now so overwhelmed by traffic that it lists to one side, and trucks are permitted to use it only at night, when it is less traveled.  The rest of Hanoi looks as listless as the bridge, as if the city had been in a time capsule since the French left in 1954 - a sleepy, backward colonial town of low yellow stucco buildings; narrow streets overarched by the lacy green leaves of tamarind trees. Water buffaloes plod slowly along the streets, pulling carts of night soil through silent crowds of cyclists.  Only a few automobiles - Russian Volgas and Zhigulis - honk their way through the bicycles. The bar at the Thong Nhat hotel, frequented mainly by foreigners, stocks Vietnamese vodka, apparently for the benefit of the Russian diplomats and advisers, who appear on the streets mostly on Sundays, looking flushed and uncomfortable in synthetic clothes not designed for the summer heat and humidity.  I got occasional hints of uneasiness about these benefactors from the Vietnamese I talked to. ''Some people think the longer we receive aid from the Soviet Union, the more difficult it will be to preserve our independence,'' said Do-Xuan Oanh, a songwriter in his 50's, who said he learned English by listening to the Voice of America and now heads the Vietnamese-American Friendship Society, an organization whose sole function is to receive the few Americans who turn up in Hanoi. A high-ranking official, who said he could speak more freely if I agreed not to use his name, argued that Vietnam had nowhere else to turn except to the Russians for its most basic needs, but he said the leaders would not refuse an opening from a Western country if one materialized. He said that up to now Vietnam had not granted the Soviet Union any permanent military bases on its territory, but, he added, ''if a Soviet base constituted a necessity for our independence, then we would not refuse.'' The Soviets do use the port facilities at Cam Ranh Bay to stock and fuel their Far Eastern Fleet.  Though three years of military service is compulsory for all Vietnamese men from age 18 to 35, uniforms do not proliferate in the streets of Hanoi today. The army probably has its hands full with several hundred thousand troops fending off attacks from the remaining Pol Pot forces in Cambodia and occasionally exchanging fire with the Chinese along the northern border.  A few steps from the Government-run Thong Nhat hotel, where the amenities in my dingy room included a small Russian air-conditioner and a Chinese thermos bottle, was the state bank of Vietnam. The foreign-exchange department was in an annex, where I was the only customer. While I waited for my $300 to be converted into dong, I counted 18 people involved in the transaction, writing down serial numbers, filling out forms, examining my passport and counting and recounting both the dollars and the dong. The official conversion rate was 9.954 dong to the dollar. Outside, on the black market that flourishes in cafes and small shops, the dollar brings 16 times as much. The Government obliquely recognizes that the currency is overvalued: Even the hotels it runs convert dong at a rate five or six times the bank's.  In the shops, quite unlike the Soviet Union, where there are no private stores anymore, people were selling jewelry, Ming and Ching treasures sold off by ethnic Chinese and others who fled the country during the worst years of economic deprivation in 1978 and 1979, clothing, cigarettes and lottery tickets for private profit.  There were a few cafes where young people gathered to drink coffee, talk and listen to Western rock music. There didn't seem to be much else to do; the movie theaters advertised old films from Rumania and the Soviet Union, but were as dark as the streets much of the time because of power cuts. Some people seemed to be living on the sidewalks, begging for food, as streams of pedestrians dressed in drab cotton pants and jackets passed by.  I wondered how this could be the same country that had sent, with iron discipline, hundreds of thousands of its sons and daughters in their rubber sandals down the Ho Chi Minh Trail to their deaths. And, in a sense it wasn't. Ho had inspired the people to those sacrifices while he lived, but now all that remained of that inspiration were slogans on banners and posters.  The objective was to reunite the country. With that accomplished, Ho's successors seem to be unable to ignite enthusiasm for any other goal. They were faced immediately with the problem of feeding the country, and they failed. After a series of droughts and typhoons in the late l970's, and after the failure of a drive to collectivize the rice farmers of the Mekong Delta, the country came close to famine in 1978 and 1979. At the end of that year, socialism had been undone to the extent of encouraging small private-sector businesses and letting peasants grow crops for their own use and sale, even on Government-owned land, an accommodation unthinkable in the Soviet Union.  Thanks to this concession to economic reality, last year the country was able to do without imported rice for the first time since the war ended. ''We can feed ourselves now, but at a level you in the West would consider only the bare minimum for subsistence,'' the high-ranking official told me. ''We hope that in 15 years, we may be able to reach a minimally adequate level.''  Because of the shortage, rice and other foods are rationed, and, this being a Marxist-Leninist state, apportioned according to need as defined by the Communist authorities. Laborers in the fields or in the coal mines of northern Vietnam get rice rations of 26 kilograms a month; office workers in the Government bureaucracies in Hanoi get 12 kilograms.   The mandates of the class struggle also determine who gets an education: If your grandfather was a mandarin or an official of the French colonial administration, you don't get ahead.  One young man, a 24-year-old Vietnam 1st JUMP Page 54 & 56        said the Government wouldn't let him study foreign languages (apparently a sought-after field because it provides an opportunity to go abroad, if only to other Communist countries), taught himself rudimentary French and, with it, pleaded with me to take a letter out to an uncle he thought was living in the United States. ''I am always hungry,'' he said.  The Government gives students an allowance of 36 dong a month. The iced coffee we drank cost 25; a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of pork costs 110. The average civil servant, I was told, makes 200 dong a month.  Le Mai, a Foreign Ministry official, warned me that I would not find much in the stores for people to buy, even if they had money. ''You will see we are selling goods of very poor quality, but we are trying to produce all basic commodities by ourselves, and you have to start somewhere,'' he said. The main department store in Hanoi offered a pathetic collection of sprockets, chains, nuts and bolts for bicycles. A few garishly colored plastic sandals were displayed on unfinished wooden shelves; they cost 180 dong, or nearly $20. Tin cooking pots cost 350 dong, more than a month's salary.  Do-Xuan Oanh told me that, because of the continuing pressure from the Chinese, ''it may take a century for us to restore our economy. I do not share the view that life is only meaningful if it is accompanied by pain and hardship.'' He made it sound like a dissenting view.  Though I was surprised by how little evidence of damage there was from the American bombing in the city of Hanoi itself, I asked to meet Vietnamese who had been through the Christmas 1972 bombing, the heaviest of the war, which President Nixon had ordered to force Hanoi to accept the terms of a cease- fire. I was taken to Kham Thien Street, close to the railroad station, and all but destroyed in a B-52 raid apparently targeted on the station at 10:30 the night of Dec. 26. The raid killed 283 people and wounded 266.  There is a monument to the victims of the Christmas bombing on the site of a ruined house. A statue of a woman holding a dead child, it bears the inscription, ''Indignation at the American aggressors.'' Page 56       Nguyen Van The, a 46-year-old veteran of the North Vietnamese campaigns around Quang Tri in the South in 1972, was now the Communist Party ward committee chairman for Kham Thien. He told me how the neighborhood had been rebuilt, despite the unexploded bombs still beneath the rubble.  He took me to meet Nguyen Thi Mao, widow of a militiaman she said was killed by the American bombs. She had taken her three children out of the city to safety. Now tears came to her eyes as she talked, but, she said, ''the war is receding into the past. Because my husband was a war hero, the Government gave me food. I could feed my children and they got a good education.'' As we talked on a low wooden bench behind the bright cotton shirts and dresses she sold to help make a living, I asked her how she felt about having an American visit her in her home. ''You look very kind,'' she said. ''I was once very angry at the Americans, but now I hope they do not launch any more wars against us.''   When my Foreign Ministry interpreter and I flew from Hanoi to Da Nang, in what had been South Vietnam, it was almost like crossing into a foreign country, with border guards examining my passport and the interpreter's identity papers at both airports. We were to go in a Volga sedan up the coast to Hue and stay overnight before continuing north the next morning.  I wanted to go back to Quang Tri City, which I had last seen on the day of the cease-fire of Jan. 28, 1973. Then, it was a ruined expanse of bomb craters, shattered bricks and pieces of metal, and dead bodies. Ten years later, riding up the beautiful coastal highway from Da Nang, I wondered what, if anything, would be left of the most devastated city in the south.  On the surface, the reconstruction and rehabilitation in the port city of Da Nang and in the fishing hamlets along the way to the former Imperial capital at Hue had been impressive. Peasants were planting and harvesting rice in fields irrigated by newly built canals. The narrow-gauge railroad had been rebuilt and was now transporting passengers and freight behind Czech-built diesel locomotives, a sight I had never seen during the war. New homes, even new Buddhist temples, had been built along the road. Only stones were left where American bases had stood - Camp Eagle, home of the 101st Airborne Division; the military airfield at Phu Bai, just south of Hue; the former Marine and Army base outside Quang Tri.  We turned down a dirt road that led to Quang Tri City. Somehow, that bleak moonscape of rubble had been resettled and rebuilt with cement and brick houses. A theater was under construction as well as a district bank. Only a small area was empty, where there were still too many unexploded bombs in the ground to make habitation possible, the officials said. It was hardly grand, but it was life in a place from which I thought human beings had been driven forever. After the decay and paralysis of Hanoi, this reconstruction was amazing.  We crossed a new bridge to the other side of the river, where I had watched the North Vietnamese raise their flags on the cease-fire day a decade ago, and continued north to the village of Dong Ha.  My first visit to Dong Ha was in 1968. I was in the Navy, writing press releases about coastal bombardment by the ships of the Seventh Fleet, then including the battleship U.S.S. New Jersey, whose 16-inch guns fired 2,700-pound projectiles. The Marine base I had visited in my Navy days was gone, but there was a brand-new railroad depot and a comfortable Government guest house, where I was received by Duong Tu Anh, like me, a 40-year-old veteran of the war. Mr. Anh remembered the Seventh Fleet with horror. ''I saw that bombardment with my own eyes,'' he said, ''and that was the worst year.'' I decided to keep quiet.  After the Americans were gone, the Vietnam 2nd Jump        North Vietnamese swept south and seized Dong Ha in 1972, and they held it despite attacks from B-52's at least as severe as those at Quang Tri.  ''The South Vietnamese generals said the land was 200 percent destroyed,'' Mr. Anh said, ''on top and underground.''  Mr. Anh said that more than 2,000 people had been injured or killed by buried bombs in his district since 1975. For all of the surrounding province, which has a population of 1.8 million, there had been 5,000 such casualties, according to the authorities.  I was later taken to a pepper farm established in the mountains to the west of Dong Ha, on the site of an American artillery position known as Hill 241. It was a collective, like most of the rice and vegetable farms set up in central Vietnam since reunification; the people here were less resistant to the idea of collectivization than the farmers farther south in the Mekong Delta, where even today only 20 percent belong to collectives, according to officials in Hanoi.  On this pepper farm, one woman carrying fertilizer to the plants asked my interpreter where I came from and laughed when she found out. ''VC!'' she exclaimed, pointing to herself. Other members of the collective were former South Vietnamese Army soldiers. The enterprise sells peppercorns to a state-owned export firm to earn foreign currency.  The vice director of the farm showed me around and, in response to my question, said, yes, someone had recently been killed by a mine in the ground - the 4-year-old son of the chairman, who, on the way to a swimming hole, had tripped over a stone and detonated an antipersonnel mine.  And there is more death in the ground. Defoliants, including Agent Orange, whose contaminants include dioxin, which is dangerous even in trace amounts, were sprayed over the entire country from 1962 to 1971. According to Pentagon figures, the total amount of dioxin dumped on Vietnam may have been at least 375 pounds. An international conference in Ho Chi Minh City last January, which included Western doctors, agreed on this figure despite some feeling among the Vietnamese that it should have been much higher.  The A Luoi Valley, which begins at Dong Ha and extends into the mountain ranges to the southwest, was reduced from triple-canopy jungle to grassland by the spraying. It is one of the sites where the Vietnamese suspect dioxin and other chemical poisons to be the cause of an increase in birth deformities in children of people exposed to the chemicals. In one sprayed village in the Mekong Delta, Vietnamese researchers have determined that, among exposed subjects, the number of pregnancies ending in spontaneous abortions was 47.03 percent of the total. ''There are many deformed children here,'' Mr. Anh said, ''but I cannot say how many.''  Returning to Hue that afternoon, I talked to Nguyen Van Luong, the highest official of Binh Tri Thien province and one of the rare Southern guerrillas in a position of authority I was to meet during my brief stay; most of the others were North Vietnamese. He had been the chairman of the Vietcong organization in the Dong Ha district in the early 1960's.  ''During the war,'' he said, ''I took the name Le Viet Huong. I understand the Americans promised the people of Dong Ha a five-million-piaster reward for my head when I was there. I lived underground, in a shelter. Sometimes I would hear noises above during the day. And at night, when I came out, I would ask my friends who had been up there. 'Green Berets,' they said. They used long sticks to probe the shelter, but they never found me.'' (The Phoenix program, run under American auspices during the war, specifically targeted Vietcong leaders for assassination.)  Luong waxed nostalgic about the war years, though he was wounded three times: ''When I was in the jungle, I used to go fishing, and we'd have picnics. I had all my belongings in a backpack. I could go anywhere. When the Americans launched sweeps to find us, we'd just withdraw and return after they'd gone.  ''The Americans who were against the war in Vietnam share in our victory,'' he went on. ''We have suffered the worst war in modern history, from 1941 to 1975. Now we are at peace, despite the war on our northern border with China. Let the Americans know: We defeated the Mongols. We defeated the French. We defeated the Chinese reactionaries, supported by the Americans. But we know how to distinguish between the Chinese people and the Chinese leaders, between the American people and the American authorities.''  As we drove back to Da Nang, I was struck by how quiet the countryside was now. There was not much traffic, and the pavement was being used by the local farmers to dry manioc and cassava and even to thresh rice. Military patrols controlled the entrances to the Hai Van pass, apparently to guard against an invasion from the sea by the Chinese, who hold the Paracel Islands offshore.  In Da Nang itself, the air bases formerly used by the Americans are now used by the Vietnamese Air Force. I saw a battery of surface-to- air missiles in an emplacement near the base I had remembered as Marble Mountain. Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told me later that they were there primarily to repel any possible Chinese air attack.  Three Communist journalists I was taken to meet in Da Nang told me there were 110,000 former South Vietnamese soldiers and their families living among them - like equals, they claimed; no grudges held, no scores settled, no second-class status.  On my last day in Da Nang, one of my escorts took me aside and revealed that he had been in the South Vietnamese Army, and that he would leave the country and move to the United States if he could. His background limited him to a low-paying job here and would as long as he lived. ''Not enough to eat here,'' he said.   We flew to Ho Chi Minh City - Saigon - on a Soviet-built Antonov turboprop plane. If Hanoi had been untouched for 30 or 40 years, Ho Chi Minh City looked precisely the way it had in 1973, when I was last there, except that the streets were far less congested. The Majestic Hotel on the riverfront had the same fly- specked 1950's-vintage Pan American World Airways pictures on its walls, though the hotel was now called the Cuu Long and was state owned.  Many of the restaurants I had remembered from the past were still functioning. Givral's, the French patisserie, was still baking croissants. The bars that had lined the downtown streets when the Americans were there had been shut or converted into antique shops.  On Dong Khoi (General Uprising) Street (Tu Do to the Americans, Rue Catinat to the French), beggar urchins were selling peanuts and yelling, ''Hey, you!'' just as they used to when the Americans were there. But now these were not Vietnamese beggars. I saw with stunned sorrow that many of them had strikingly American faces - the young Amerasians whose situation in the country is so desperate.  I was surprised in Ho Chi Minh City, as I had been in Hanoi, by what the authorities allowed to go on under their noses. The first few times I left the hotel alone and tried to make my way up the street, I was attacked by money changers offering 170, 180 dong to the dollar, about 20 times the official rate, and the Amerasian children followed me all the way to the cathedral, asking for handouts. Other days, the sidewalk was completely clear, the street people eyeing me nervously from across the road, apparently after a police sweep; a few hours later, the parasites and black marketeers were back at their usual positions.  Only once was I made aware of being followed by a plainclothes policeman. He gave a dirty look to a small Amerasian boy who had been pestering me to buy him a shirt; the kid then whispered to me, ''C.I.D.,'' the American G.I.'s code for Military Police narcotics detectives. I felt, and was warned, that the only possible purpose he could have in following me was to report on any Vietnamese I spoke with.  Vietnam 3rd JUMP        I tried to challenge this prohibition twice. The first man I visited, a person with relatives in the United States who had applied for permission to leave Vietnam to join them, welcomed me to his house in a rainstorm, but nervously looked out the door and after 10 minutes asked me to please leave before the police came. Apparently he feared a search and interrogation about my presence. I went next door to a restaurant, and two plainclothes agents were pointed out to me. When I left, at the nervous urging of the restaurant owner, they did not follow me and I assumed my host was getting the questioning he feared. He wrote later to his family through the censored mail that he was grateful for my visit.  The second time, visiting a widow whose husband had been the night watchman in The Times's office, my presence caused such a sensation among the hordes of excited children in the neighborhood that I left her after only a few minutes, hoping to avoid the arrival of the police. She, too, hoped somehow to emigrate to the United States.   Ho Chi Minh City, I felt at moments like this, was still an occupied city, occupied by the Communist Northerners who run the country and still don't trust the Southern Vietnamese for collaborating with us. But, according to Nguyen Co Thach, the Foreign Minister, ''there was no bloodbath. We had 1.5 million people in re-education camps, and 10,000 of them are still there now. But not one of them was killed in capital punishment. That's no good.'' Perhaps he and Pham Van Dong and Vo Nguyen Giap, the North Vietnamese commander who won the war, and the others had seen enough blood and death to reject the idea of a purge.  Stalin would have known how to re-educate these people, and no one would ever have come back. He would have known how to stop the black market and how to get the jobless off the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, too. Pol Pot, in Cambodia, and not Ho Chi Minh's successors in Vietnam, had turned out to be the last true Stalinist in Asia, contrary to all American expectations during the war.  True, the bloodbath never came. But another kind of death - of any hope of a decent life here under the new regime - does drive many of the Vietnamese to try to leave.  When or whether those who apply will get exit visas is hard to tell. Through the Orderly Departure Program, set up under the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 1979, Vietnamese who can get permission from their Government to leave, and from some other country to let them in, are allowed to leave.  Mr. Tuyen told me that so far the Vietnamese had granted 18,000 exit visas to people wanting to go to the United States under the program, but up to the time I talked to him in September, only 12,200, according to American officials, had been given permission to enter the country. Mr. Tuyen acknowledged that his office had received 32,500 applications from Ho Chi Minh City alone - equal to the total number of people who have been allowed out under the program since it began.  There has been a gradual and steady decline in illegal departures, which have totaled about one million since 1975, apparently because refugees have been refused entry in many places. For example, ''boat people'' arriving in Hong Kong now must choose between moving on to another port or spending the rest of their lives in a closed refugee camp.  The Communists explain that these people want to leave because they grew accustomed to artificially high living standards during the American occupation. But I suspect the real reason is that in Vietnam they simply have no future.  Take the case of a young man who had been studying medicine in Saigon when he was drafted into the South Vietnamese Army in the early 1970's. After the defeat, he was no longer eligible to continue his medical studies, because he had been drafted into the wrong army. His mother was killed in the war with the French in 195l; his father was killed in fighting with the United States Marines in 1967; but for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, he was now consigned to a life as a tour-bus driver at 130 dong a month.  Ly Cong Chanh, a former official of the Provisional Revolutionary Government who is now vice chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, told me that there were still more than 200,000 people without jobs. I met one foreign resident of the city who thought the real figure was much higher, as much as 60 percent of the work force.  Mr. Chanh sounded resigned. ''More than 700,000 people left the city for new economic zones, or for their native villages, after liberation,'' he said, ''but about 10,000 of them couldn't survive in the zones and came back. We tell them that if they stay here, they'll get no house and no job, but we don't move them out to the countryside by force. If we did, they'd just come back again. It's no use,'' he said.  I asked to see one of the new economic zones and was taken to a sugarcane farm called Nhi Xuan not far from Ho Chi Minh City in what used to be an artillery free- fire zone during the war. It was obviously meant to be a showcase; the guest book showed a parade of foreign dignitaries, including a number of predictably enthusiastic Russians.  Still, it was very poor: a line of tin-roofed wooden shacks along an irrigation canal, packed earth floors, no electricity or potable water except rainwater from earthenware cisterns. The people grew their own food, and collected rations - a pound of meat and a pound of fish per month, per family; some people raised chickens or geese.  This was a model zone built by ''youth volunteers,'' who dug the canals, turned the sod and built the houses for the refugees who came later. I gathered from various conversations that many of these volunteers were renegades or former soldiers or drug addicts given a chance to atone for their misdeeds and find a better life after two or three years of hard work. The families who came to live and work on the farm, I was told, got their houses free and an allowance of 20,000 dong to get started.  Mr. Chanh, talking to me later in the ornate 19th-century city hall in Ho Chi Minh City, told me the authorities hoped gradually to solve the problem of unemployment there by putting people to work on the few nearby industrial development projects - a rubber plantation, a hydroelectric dam, the oil exploration project being worked on with Russian help at the former beach resort of Vung Tau. But for the most part, the economy of Ho Chi Minh City is still based on small- scale trading and commerce, a service economy built up during the boom years when 500,000 G.I.'s were there - 200,000 households in Saigon still earn their living this way today, according to official Vietnamese statistics.  ''We're trying to reduce them little by little and transform them from trading to production,'' Mr. Chanh said. ''We have to do this step by step.''  Fits and starts might be a more accurate description of Vietnamese economic policy since 1975. At first, pledging a gradual transition to socialism, the new Communist rulers left the farmers and merchants of the South alone. Then, in March 1978, the bigger trading firms, many owned by Chinese businessmen from Cholon, were closed and nationalized.  The course was partly reversed again in late 1979 to avert a complete economic collapse. The latest measures, instituted last May, penalize small businesses with heavy taxes.  ''We have had a lot of experience in war,'' Mr. Chanh said, ''but not in administering the affairs of a big city like this. We have made many mistakes. I am 59, and Mai Chi Tho, the chairman of the city committee, is 60. We have to train our successors, so they won't make the mistakes we made.''  The mistakes have alienated many South Vietnamese who welcomed the Communist victory in 1975. A few, like Ngo Ba Thanh, a professor educated in Paris and New York who spent years in jail during the rule of President Nguyen Van Thieu, try to bridge the gaps in understanding.  ''Most of the mistakes that have been made are the result of trying to move too fast,'' she said, speaking in a rush of fluent English. ''And there are great differences between the North and the South. I tell the people in the party that the revolution would not have been won with the party alone. The people played a great role and must be allowed to continue to play a great role. The party authorities sometimes claim that they can do anything they want, even if it violates the laws on the books, because in our system the party plays the leading role. But it's more complicated than that.''  ''Pham Van Dong told me that I had to be very patient,'' she said. ''He pointed out to me this Cabinet minister who was a rice farmer 40 years ago, and that one who had been illiterate, and said I should give these people a chance, should be tolerant of their mistakes.''  She also said she did not agree with many of her friends in the South who complained about not having a big enough role in the Government. ''We in the South have lots of experience in overthrowing governments,'' she said with a laugh, ''not in making them run better.''  Other people in the South Vietnamese educated class aren't as optimistic as Mrs. Thanh, or as well treated, and many who hated the Thieu regime now say they were wrong to think that nothing could be worse than the corruption and repression of that period.  ''The Thieu Government collapsed because its leaders were unworthy of the name,'' a former student told me. ''But now many people who were glad to see it go feel that the new Government isn't so gay, either. They've lost their illusions. They don't like having to apply to the ward committee and pay a bribe even to get permission to go visit their relatives in the Mekong Delta for a week. But they still delude themselves. A lot of them talk about how the Americans are going to land with helicopters and sweep the Communists away. The Americans - imagine!''  I asked if people blamed the United States for the defeat - as some Americans blame themselves for not providing Thieu with enough military aid to fight off the Communist advances. ''I don't blame the Americans at all,'' he said. ''They gave plenty of money and help, and it wasn't their fault that our generals and leaders couldn't put it to proper use. It is our country. It was ours to defend - we should have defended it ourselves.''  That is precisely why the Communists won, I said - they really believed it. He shrugged. ''It's true,'' he said.   Ho Chi Minh's saying, ''There is nothing more precious than independence and freedom,'' now stands above nearly every door in Vietnam. Many people in the South put it there in the last days of April 1975, hoping to show the Communists their hearts were in the right place. Even with all the help they have from the Russians, I concluded, the Vietnamese have independence, but freedom, no, not now.  Many of the Communist war veterans I had met in my two-week trip had emotionally expressed their wishes for peace, for their children, my children, all our children together. We were veterans of the same war, and we felt, strange as it may seem, a sense of shared responsibility for what we had done to each other. Perhaps, eventually, passions will cool and we will, like the French before us, extend the hand of aid and conciliation to this fiercely independent, xenophobic people.   The only flight out of Saigon to the West is an Air France jumbo jet that arrives practically empty from Paris via Bangkok every Thursday and goes back full of refugees. For the first time in my experience in Communist countries, my Vietnamese hosts let me take pictures in the airport as I interviewed those who were leaving. Finally, when the shuttle bus pulled out, their relatives shrieked their names desperately from the observation platform.  There was nervous tension among these people as we went through yet another ticket check on the gangway; they would not believe they were really leaving until the plane started rolling down the runway. But as the doors were sealed and the engines began turning, I looked back into the cabin and saw that it would be impossible to continue interviewing them. Their native land was rushing past the windows, and tears were streaming down their faces, and so there was no need to ask any more questions.

Under the agreement, the two countries will expand their exchange of goods and cooperation in joint enterprises, the official radio said in a broadcast monitored here.

The report, monitored in Bangkok, did not identify any of the servicemen.  This week the team, from the United States Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Honolulu, conducted the first official American inspection of the site where a United States Air Force C-130 cargo plane crashed Dec. 21, 1972, after having been hit by antiaircraft fire.

"      The United States and the Communist Government of Laos, after years of tense relations, have quietly begun discussions aimed at upgrading their diplomatic missions and gaining closer ties, Administration officials said today.  In recent months, they said, Laos has sent several significant signals to the Reagan Administration that State Department and White House officials view as opening the way to firmer links between Vientiane and Washington. These include welcoming and assisting an American group searching for information on United States servicemen missing in action since the Indochina war, as well as affording American diplomats access to Laotian Government officials for the first time in years.  ''They want to move forward,'' an Administration official said.  Another official remarked, ''They appear more flexible, more sensitive.''  S.I. Hayakawa, the former Republican Senator from California who was chairman of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before he left Congress last year, is scheduled to visit Laos this month in the course of an Asian trip to ''further signal our interest,'' one Administration official said.  Under Hanoi's Dominance  Laos, an impoverished, landlocked nation on the Indochinese peninsula, has remained under the dominance of neighboring Vietnam since the collapse of the South Vietnamese Government in Saigon in April 1975. At that point, the Laotian monarchy was abolished, the coalition Government that sought neutrality collapsed and the Communist Lao People's Democratic Party was established. There are currently about 50,000 Vietnamese soldiers and 36,000 Laotian troops in the country.  United States officials say talks with Laos remain sensitive, largely because of Vietnam's dominance, if not control, over the Laotian Government. The United States has no diplomatic relations with Hanoi, mainly because of Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.  ''We view Vietnam and Laos as different entities despite Vietnam's occupation of Laos and the top leadership being advised very strongly by Vietnam,'' said one official. He noted that the Laotians are culturally, ethnically and linguistically far closer to Thailand and other Asian nations than to Vietnam.  Although the move by Laos to seek better relations with the United States ''has a dynamic of its own,'' the decision probably has the ''blessing'' of the Hanoi Government, said one Administration official involved in the talks. Vietnam's diplomatic isolation because of its occupation of Cambodia, and its heavy reliance on the Soviet Union, are viewed by United States officials as key reasons for Hanoi's efforts to ''reverse the current trend'' and open up Laotian relations with the United States.  Missions May Be Upgraded  According to several officials, the measures under discussion include an upgrading to ambassador status of the diplomatic missions in Washington and Vientiane. Currently, the highest-ranking diplomats in both missions, which are kept to a handful of personnel, are those with charge d'affaires status.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 16 1983 ,2
"      A former South Vietnamese Prime Minister, now a refugee awaiting resettlement, says he had to abandon his wife and child as he fled his homeland in a flimsy wooden craft under cover of dark.  Nguyen Van Loc, Prime Minister in 1967-68 under President Nguyen Van Thieu, said in an interview last Tuesday that he made his escape on May 10 after hiding with his family for nearly 18 months south of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.  It was his 14th attempt to escape, he said, but his wife and 11-month-old child could not join him as planned because fishermen demanding money to keep their departure a secret stopped them from taking a rowboat to the refugee craft.  Mr. Loc, 62 years old, said his wife had saved the money for the trip while he was in a labor camp near Hanoi. He said he was sure she and their child would get out of Vietnam soon.  Near Starvation Diet  Mr. Loc said he had spent four years in the camp before being returned to Ho Chi Minh City.  ''I nearly died in the labor camp, where I was kept with about 1,500 others on a near starvation diet,'' he said. ''They let me return to Saigon in 1980 only after they felt that I was dying.''  Mr. Loc said two or three people died of malnutrition or disease every week at the labor camp.  The inmates, most of them former South Vietnamese military and security personnel, politicians and high-ranking Government officials, were ordered to clear a jungle swamp, farm the area and build a dam, he said. They were also made to cut boulders and carry them one mile to build their own homes and the dam, Mr. Loc said.  ''The stronger among us were made to pull the plows at a jungle clearing hardly suitable for cultivation,'' he said.  Says Camp Still Exists  He added: ''Each person was given a monthly ration of 34 pounds of corn and some salt. On very rare occasions we were given a small quantity of vegetables.'' the former Prime Minister said the camp, described by Vietnamese officials as a re-education center, was still in operation.  He said he was sent there after being held six months at a police detention camp near Ho Chi Minh City after the Communist takeover of South Vietnam in 1975.  ''I weighed 154 pounds when I arrived at the camp,'' he said, ''and only 115 pounds when I returned to Saigon.'' Mr. Loc, who was picked up by a French container ship on May 12 with 32 other so-called boat people, said resistance to the Hanoi Government was growing in southern Vietnam.  Thousands of Vietnamese are planning to leave, he said, and will not be deterred by the Government's use of extra naval patrols.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 28 1983 ,0

"      Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia arrived today on an official visit that could be marred by disagreement over his Government's plan to resume aid to Vietnam.  The issue of economic aid to Vietnam is certain to be the most sensitive topic in discussions Mr. Hawke will have with President Reagan and other top Administation officials during his four-day stay.  A State Department official made clear to reporters on the eve of the visit that the United States viewed Mr. Hawke's proposal to resume aid to Hanoi before Vietnamese forces are withdrawn from Cambodia as ''very unhelpful.''  Mr. Hawke's Labor Party, which won Australia's general elections in March, is pledged to resume aid to Vietnam that was suspended when Vietnam took control of much of Cambodia in January 1979.  The State Department official said that during the talks U.S.  officials would ''note that the U.S. opposes sending aid to Vietnam'' as long as Vietnamese forces remain in Cambodia.

"   , Thailand, June 28   A senior Reagan Administration official said today that the United States had information that kept it from ruling out the possibility that some Americans captured during the Vietnam War are still alive.  The official said the Administration ''has information in its possesion that precludes ruling out the possibility that live Americans are being held captive in Indochina.''  The official said more than 200 reports from refugees who claimed to have seen American prisoners in Indochina in recent years could not be dismissed. He said polygraph tests supported many of the refugees' reports.  Because of these reports, the official said, the Reagan Administration decided to increase diplomatic efforts to account for missing Americans and to expand intelligence-collection to try to check the refugees' reports. He said the Administration had asked Congress to increase by 25 percent the number of analysts working on the problem in the Defense Intelligence Agency. He said there were 14 or 15 analysts now.  Shultz Addresses Issue  The issue came up today when Secretary of State George P. Shultz appeared to endorse private efforts to recover dead American servicemen in Indochina, a position contradictory to that of the Administration.  Mr. Shultz, speaking at a news conference at the end of a meeting of Southeast Asian nations, said the American Government was for ''any means that can be effective'' in locating and recovering the 2,494 Americans listed as missing in action. He also refused to rule out Government support for a recovery mission headed by James G. (Bo) Gritz, a former Army Special Forces officer in Vietnam who led a mission into Laos last year that failed.  Mr. Shultz's comments contradicted assertions by the Reagan Administration that it considered such private efforts illegal and damaging to official efforts with the same goal.  Immediately after the news conference, State Department officials traveling with Mr. Shultz said that he had not meant to endorse such private efforts and that the Reagan Administration remained opposed to them. They said Mr. Shultz might have been confused because he was not fully briefed about the issue, was not familiar with Mr. Gritz's history and had apparently misunderstood a question.  When asked whether the United States would support a mission by Mr. Gritz, Mr. Shultz said, ''The answer is very unlikely, but these things would have to looked upon case by case.''  U.S. Sought Asians' Help  Mr. Shultz's remarks grew out of the Administration's effort to make the recovery of American dead in Indochina a major issue at the meeting here of the Foreign Ministers of the five countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines - and their six so-called dialogue partners, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, West Germany and the United States.  In a speech to the five Foreign Ministers today Mr. Shultz asked their help in accounting for the missing. He described the issue as a ''matter of the highest priority for President Reagan and for the American people.''  The official said that in a closed meeting with the Foreign Ministers, Mr. Shultz reported that the United States had information indicating that 400 dead Americans were being ''deliberately withheld'' by Vietnam. Mr. Shultz, an official said, called the Vietnamese action ''cruel and heartless.''  Later, after the news conference, the official who spoke about the possibility that Americans are still being held captive said that the information about the 400 American war dead came from a Vietnamese undertaker who defected to the United States several years ago. The official said the undertaker's account was also supported by the results of a polygraph test, the so-called lie-detector test.  The Mission Into Laos  The issue of missing serviceman returned to prominence this year when Mr. Gritz turned himself in to the Thai authorities, who had sought him for illegally crossing the border between Thailand and Laos.  Mr. Gritz, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, led a small band of Americans and Indochinese into Laos last year to try to find the missing dead and check reports about American prisoners.  Several prominent Americans, including William Shatner, the star of the television series ''Star Trek,'' later said they had helped pay for the Gritz mission. It failed when the men were discovered and attacked by Laotian military forces. Mr. Gritz and his colleagues fled back to Thailand.  After the mission was disclosed, the Reagan Administration denied claims by Mr. Gritz that he had received support from the Defense Department. The Administration also condemned the effort, saying it opposed illegal, cross-border forays.  At the news conference, Mr. Shultz said that working ''through official channels is probably in the long run the most effective method.'' But he added, ''Clearly, we are anxious to have any method used that would help return the remains of the deceased and provide information for us and for the families on those who are missing.''  Asked what sort of methods he would support, Mr. Shultz said, ''The key word is if it has a good chance of being effective.'' He also said, ''Of course, any means that can be effective we're for.''  Mr. Shultz is scheduled to fly from to New Delhi on Wednesday for two days of talks with Indian leaders. His Asian trip will end with a stop in Pakistan.  ----  8 War Dead Identified  WASHINGTON, June 28 (AP) - The Pentagon today identified eight Air Force and Navy dead from the Vietnam war who were turned over to an American delegation in Hanoi this month.

"   , Thailand, July 2   Thirteen people accused of plotting to overthrow the Vietnamese Government have been punished by the People's Court in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, the Vietnamese press agency reported today.  The agency, monitored here, said Nguyen Van Hien was the leader of the group and was an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency. He was sentenced to life in prison.  His accomplices received sentences ranging from warnings to 15 years in prison for ''a dangerous organized action of subversion,'' the agency said.  It said the 13 defendants, who were tried in public, had misused religion for their activities by meeting in the Dac Lo Monastery in Ho Chi Minh City to carry out counterrevolutionary programs.

"      Three years have passed since the Golden Dolphin, a British ship, plucked Van Thinh and other Vietnamese refugees from a wave-tossed boat in the South China Sea.  Last month Van Thinh and another young Vietnamese refugee were sentenced to life imprisonment here for the murder of seven Chinese employees of an illegal gambling club in the Soho district of London.  His journey from salvation to a British prison cell has thrust the saga of the ''boat people'' back into public view long after about 16,000 were welcomed to these shores and then nearly forgotten.  Unlike the United States and France, which are the hosts to the largest numbers of refugees from Southeast Asia, Britain had no direct hand in the events that led to the exodus from Vietnam. It was the humanity of British sea captains who rescued the boat people at sea, and the decision by the Government in London to relieve Hong Kong of the tide of refugees that swept into the port of the British colony, that opened the doors for settlement here.  Gesture Now Seen as a Failure  Now, by most accounts, the humanitarian gesture by the British is seen as a tragic failure.  The boat people reached Britain in the teeth of an economic storm.  Two out of three were ethnic Chinese peasants and fishermen from northern Vietnam who were forced to flee because of repercussions that grew out of border conflicts with China. With little knowledge of English and few useful skills in an industrialized society, more than 80 percent of those who want work have been unable to find jobs in a country where the unemployment rate is more than 13 percent.  ''The married men sit in their council flats all day depressed because there is no work for them,'' said Dang Phuoc Tri, a 33-yearold fieldworker with the British Refugee Council, one of three organizations trying to help the Vietnamese cope with life in Britain.  ''They lose face with their families because they cannot provide,'' he said. ''They risk everything to get here, and now there is nothing for them to do.''  Marital discord and alcohol abuse are problems growing at an alarming rate among the Vietnamese, researchers say.  Loneliness and Anxiety  For single men like Van Thinh, 21, the frustrations of life in Britain can be even more pronounced. Many left Vietnam without families, and now they are housed with other single Vietnamese men in bleak rooms in public housing or hostels for the homeless in London and other British cities without prospects for a job or marriage.  A generous social welfare system provides the Vietnamese with the same benefits available to all British subjects. But loneliness and anxiety lead many of the young men into illegal gambling parlors as an exciting outlet to an otherwise drab existence.  Mah-jongg is a gambling tradition among the Vietnamese, and many in London organize betting parlors in their homes. The small Chinatown in London offers illegal clubs run by rings called triads linked with Hong Kong crime families, according to the police.  Van Thinh, who worked as a baker's assistant, and Nguyen Vu Linh, now 24, were among a group of Vietnamese ejected from a club one night last summer. Hours later the club was set ablaze with gasoline, and seven staff members died in the fire.  More Outbursts Are Feared  Refugee council fieldworkers worry that more violent outbursts are likely if conditions do not improve for the Vietnamese men.  ''The resettlement of Vietnamese in Britain was a noble humanitarian gesture but totally crazy in a practical sense,'' Colin Hodgetts, the council's settlement services director, said.  Unlike other modern immigrants to Britain from Commonwealth countries in Asia, Africa and the West Indies, Mr. Hodgetts pointed out, the Vietnamese had no natural base of support established here to help with housing or menial jobs in family-run stores. Private agencies financed with Government money approached the resettlement task with the notion that a few English lessons was all that was required to integrate the Vietnamese into British society, he said.  A fear of ''ghettoization'' also shaped a Government policy to scatter the boat people around Britain. A result of this, Mr.  Hodgetts said, was that Vietnamese placed in Scotland and Northern Ireland suffered even stronger feelings of isolation, removed from contact with anyone who spoke their language or understood their culture.  'An Appalling Problem'  ''Our minds in 1979 weren't moving as fast as our hearts,'' he added. ''It may be the island mentality of the British that all you have to do is give some stranger a few lessons in English and he'll fit right in. As an exercise in social engineering, getting them slotted into British life actually turned into an appalling problem.''  Many of the Vietnamese have been allowed to migrate to three urban centers where fieldworkers from the agencies who speak Vietnamese or Chinese are available to help move them through some of the thornier or confusing aspects of British life. Financing for the agencies, however, is on a yearly basis, and Parliament has been debating whether it should be continued.  There is just so much a social caseworker can do when the biggest need of the Vietnamese is jobs. ''It puts a great strain on our workers,'' Mr. Hodgetts said. ''They know what will help keep these families from being destroyed, but they can't provide it.''  Mr. Dang, the caseworker, said he was worried that some of the Vietnamese would be driven by despair to suicide. ''That has not happened yet, but a lot of the men feel at the end of their rope.  They leave behind families to come to Britain with hope to be better than what they were before. Now even hope is gone from them.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 4 1983 ,0
"    McNamara had been a brilliant corporation executive who could scan a balance sheet with unerring speed and skill. When he made the first of his many trips to Vietnam in May 1962, he looked at the figures and concluded optimistically after only 48 hours in the country that ''every quantitative measurement . . . shows that we are winning the war.''  No conflict in history was studied in such detail as it was being waged. Military and civilian officials from nearly every Washington agency would sooner or later conduct surveys in Vietnam, along with specialists from dozens of private think tanks, like the Rand Corporation and the Stanford Research Institute. They included weapons technicians, economists, sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, agronomists, biologists, chemists and public opinion pollsters. They investigated the effects of defoliants, the impact of bombs, the efficiency of cannons. They scoured villages and interviewed peasants. They interrogated enemy defectors and prisoners. They pored over captured Communist documents and scrutinized Hanoi statements - and they produced voluminous graphs, charts, pamphlets, brochures and books. But the statistics somehow failed to convey an accurate picture of the problem, much less offer solutions.  For the missing element in the ''quantitative measurement'' that guided McNamara and other U.S. policymakers was the qualitative dimension that could not easily be recorded. There was no way to calibrate the motivation of Vietcong guerrillas. Nor could computers be programmed to describe the hopes and fears of Vietnamese peasants. The arcane maneuvers of Diem and his family also baffled U.S. diplomats, who were even less equipped to influence their decisions.  As the war intensified, American civilian officials and soldiers were spurred on by a myopic sense of ''can- doism'' - the conviction that, as Americans, they could achieve anything anywhere. Their belief in their own omnipotence was stimulated, too, by pressures from their superiors in Saigon and Washington. To adopt a negative attitude was defeatism, and there were no promotions for defeatists. In contrast, positive reports were rewarded, even if they bore little resemblance to the truth.  Yet another impulse that generated Americans in Vietnam was a brand of missionary zeal, not unlike the credo that had inspired early French imperialists. But Americans gave it a different guise. They were not imposing colonialism but, rather, helping the Vietnamese to perfect their institutions. They called it ''nation-building,'' and they would have been arrogant had they not been utterly sincere in their naive belief that they could really reconstruct Vietnamese society along Western lines.

"      It remains one of the final reminders that the Vietnam War is not completely over.  Once a month, in a State Department conference room, half a dozen Government officials and one outsider meet behind a closed door to discuss whatever new information and rumor has emerged about the fate of the 2,491 Americans missing in Indochina. The solemn bureacratic chatter is tinged with elements of anger, pain and heartbreak.  ''There is still, simply, a great deal of emotional drain for families,'' said Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. ''A lot of kids want to know what happened to their fathers. The drain continues, after all these years.''  Miss Griffiths, whose brother, Lieut. Comdr. Jim Mills, was shot down off the coast of Vietnam on Sept. 21, 1966, is the only non-Government participant at the monthly meetings, which are attended by representatives of the Pentagon, White House, Defense Intelligence Agency, Joint Chiefs of Staff and other agencies.  Although the meetings are listed as confidential, Miss Griffiths is allowed to attend because of the ''strong interest'' of the families involved. The chairman of the meetings is John Monjo, an Assistant Secretary of State.  Vietnamese 'Not Cooperative'  In the meantime, American and Vietnamese officials meet four times a year in Hanoi to exchange specific information about missing Americans, mostly Air Force and Navy pilots and crew members who were shot down over Vietnam and Laos.  ''The Vietnamese have not been cooperative to any appreciable extent,'' said one State Department official. ''They seem to dribble out remains as it suits their purpose. There's pretty good reason to believe they may have 400 remains, stacked up, ready to turn over at will, somewhere in Hanoi.''  Although the Vietnamese have denied this, the State Department official said that the information was based on ''credible information.''  Why would the Vietnamese hold such remains?  ''Everything they do, as far as we're concerned, is bound to reflect a political advantage they want to gain,'' said the official. ''We assume they would want to trade the remains for something in return.''  On the murky issue of whether surviving Americans are being held against their will, the State Department speaks in qualified tones.  Unconfirmed Sightings  ''It's conceivable,'' said one official. ''Our position is we have received a variety of reports of live sightings. We take action to investigate these. We have not been able to confirm that there are any Americans being held against their will in Indochina.''  In recent years there have been unconfirmed refugee reports of sightings of missing Americans in the jungles of Southeast Asia, as well as repeated accusations that the Hanoi Government was withholding remains. Hanoi has said that the dense jungles in which many Americans were lost during the war made it impossible for them to find further remains. Since the end of the war the Vietnamese have returned 87 bodies.  Officials believe there may be a certain number of American deserters and others, some married to local women, who have remained behind in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, at their own choice.  Miss Griffiths said that the revived interest in the fate of Americans in Indochina was the direct result of President Reagan's personal involvement in the issue.  ''It was different under Nixon, Ford and Carter,'' she said. ''That's changed now. This President cares.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 27 1983 ,2
"   , Calif., Jan. 21   ''We are enjoying life,'' said Nguyen Cao Ky, the former Prime Minister of South Vietnam, who was sitting with his wife in the Saigon Deli.  Nevertheless, Mr. Ky said, life in exile has presented some problems. Last week Mr. Ky held a news conference to discuss his recent bankruptcy petition and to respond to news articles that linked him to groups of South Vietnamese extortionists who prey on southern California businesses. The articles, by the syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, also said Mr. Ky fled South Vietnam in 1975 with $8 million in gold, diamonds and currency.  Mr. Ky said he had sent a letter to Mr. Anderson demanding a retraction for the articles, which he characterized as ''misleading and libelous.''  ''I am not some secret society chieftain heading a collection of thugs,'' Mr. Ky told reporters. ''I am a man who tried to serve his country as a soldier.''  $615,000 in Debts  Last November Mr. Ky, who is 54 years old, filed for protection from creditors in Federal bankruptcy court. In the petition, which was amended Jan. 12, Mr. Ky listed $615,000 in debts to businesses and banks around the country, including a $20,000 gambling debt to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. He listed nearly $700,000 in assets, including $27,000 income from a $400,000 liquor store he owns in Garden Grove, Calif., and his house, which is assessed at $250,000.  Mr. Ky said that even though he was not insolvent he filed for bankruptcy when an agreement could not be reached on an $18,000 debt incurred by a boutique operated by his wife, Mai Nguyen.  Linked to Vietnamese Gangs  The financial problems are ''temporary,'' Mr. Ky said, adding that what really concerned him were the allegations in Mr. Anderson's columns.  Mr. Anderson cited a confidential report from an Arizona-based organized crime task force and interviews with police officials in 15 cities as sources for the allegations.  Mr. Ky said he felt the allegations were an attempt to discredit him as an anti-Communist spokesman and to pave the way for better United States relations with Hanoi.  ''Why else would this information come out now?'' Mr. Ky said. ''I am not a rich man. I don't even have $100,000. But eight million? That's ridiculous.''  He said speaking engagements at colleges around the country and bank loans enabled him to buy the house and liquor store.  The former Prime Minister said he viewed his recent troubles as ''just another difficult step that we will take during our lifetime.''

"   , Thailand, Feb. 22   Vietnam has given a ''clear commitment'' to move more rapidly in determining the status of the nearly 2,500 Americans still listed as missing in the Vietnam war, a member of a United States delegation to Hanoi said today.  The Vietnamese Government no longer links the missing Americans with other issues between the two countries, said Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Missing In Action-Prisoners of War Families.  Mrs. Griffiths spoke at a news conference here after traveling to Hanoi with four American officials. The delegation was led by Richard L. Armitage, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense.

"    WHEN Huynh Qui Nanh became a United States citizen two years ago, he changed his name to Martin Wynn. It was both a tribute to his American sponsor, a Lutheran minister, and a recognition of the irreversible distance he had traveled since leaving Saigon on April 27, 1975.  A former Mekong River pilot, Mr. Wynn now threads 800-foot-long tankers through the intricate passages of Upper Bay. He also serves as the genial, soft-spoken ma,itre d'h,otel at Wynn's Ba-Nam Restaurant at 3 Pike Street near the Manhattan Bridge. It is the most recent addition to this city's small but apparently flourishing battery of unpretentious Vietnamese restaurants. Unlike many of the better-known Vietnamese establishments in Paris and Washington, these places are modest in the extreme, although their food often holds its own against fancier counterparts elsewhere.  The cuisine of Vietnam, almost unknown in New York only a few years ago, offers a fascinating contrast with that of its near neighbors to the north and west. Although a close cousin to Chinese cooking, especially in technique, Vietnamese food is leaner and not as rich as Chinese, with a variety of fresh raw herbs and vegetables - mint and coriander, cucumber, lettuce and grated carrot - seldom seen in China.  Borrowing hot chili peppers and lemon grass from Thailand and curry, coconut and tamarind from India, Vietnamese cooks manage to combine these flavors in a style that is as subtle and intricate as the cooking of the subcontinent but without the overwhelming punch of that cuisine at its most aggressive. Accurate estimates of the Vietnamese population of the New York area are difficult to come by, ranging from 10,000 to 20,000. But one thing all refugee resettlement officials agree on is that the number is growing. In the last few years at least six restaurants in lower Manhattan have sprouted up and there is another near New Haven. Several food shops in Chinatown now cater to Vietnamese and most of the larger Chinese groceries also stock Vietnamese ingredients.  Sophisticated Vietnamese like to say that their cooking style is the nouvelle cuisine of Asian food. Chef Huy Eien of the Saigon Restaurant at 60 Mulberry Street explained recently through a translator that Vietnamese sauces are lighter and less oily than Chinese sauces and are added at the end of the cooking process or served separately.  Vietnam's long coastline means that fish is an important element in the traditional diet, but surprisingly beef, as a result of French influence, is prepared in a number of elegant ways and is often cooked on a brazier at the table.  The cuisine of this Southeast Asian country is as unique as its most famous ingredient, nuoc mam, the pungent sauce rendered from salted anchovies left to ferment in barrels in the tropical sun. Mention nuoc mam to an American who has spent time in Vietnam and you may see a peculiar look on his face. It is, to be frank, an acquired taste, but once acquired it is very nearly an addiction.  ''Nuoc mam is like camembert,'' Martin Wynn said recently. ''It's pretty strange at first, but eventually you get used to it.''  The fundamental ingredient in Vietnamese food, nuoc mam is present in almost every dish and on almost every table, where it takes the place of salt in Western cooking and soy sauce in Chinese. It is used as a marinade and as the basis of other sauces. Diluted with lemon juice and water, flavored with sugar, garlic and very hot little green chili peppers or sweet grated carrots, it becomes the dipping sauce called nuoc cham.  Many of the best-loved foods of Vietnam, such as cha gio (pronounced cha-YO), the Vietnamese version of spring rolls; chao thom, a delicate paste of ground shrimp and water chestnuts molded around sticks of sugar cane and grilled over charcoal, and nem nuong, sweet and spicy pork balls threaded on a skewer, as well as salads and many other foods, are dipped in nuoc cham as they are eaten.  The finest nuoc mam comes from Phu Quoc, an island off the south coast of Vietnam where fishermen put in with their catch of anchovies several times during the year. As with olive oil, the first pressing is considered the best. Nuoc mam from Phu Quoc is a clear, dark amber liquid, the color of an oloroso Sherry, with a rich aroma and the robust, mouth-filling chewiness of a great wine.  If Vietnam has a national dish, it is cha gio . Inadequately described as a Vietnamese egg roll, cha gio as prepared at Wynn's Ba-Nam makes the usual New York egg roll seem like a potato knish.  Light, crisp and delicate, cha gio are made from a combination of chopped pork, shrimp and crab, mixed with diced tree-ear mushrooms and bean thread or cellophane noodles called bun in Vietnamese. Grated carrot may be added for sweetness or little dried shrimps for their pungent, salty flavor. In the south, grated coconut often gives a distinctive flavor to the mixture.  Brittle rice wafers called banh trang, softened in warm water, are wrapped around the farce of pork and crab. The cha gio may be as small as a fat thumb or the size of a Chinese egg roll, in which case they are cut into smaller pieces before serving.  The well-wrapped packages are dropped into hot fat and deep fried until brown. Because the paper-thin rice wrapper absorbs very little fat, cha gio are wonderfully crisp and light. At Wynn's Ba-Nam they are served in the traditional manner with a platter of tender leaves of soft-head lettuce, garnished with mint, coriander, cucumber, grated carrot and scallions. Diners wrap each cha gio in a lettuce leaf, adding the other vegetables to taste, then dip the little packages into a saucer containing nuoc cham.  Cha gio is somewhat complicated to prepare but well worth the effort. For the most part, however, Vietnamese cooking is unique among Asian cuisines in that there is little distinction between home cooking and haute cuisine or restaurant-style cooking. Once the main ingredients have been procured (not always an easy task outside New York), the dishes are not difficult to prepare at home.  Soup in Vietnam is traditionally served for breakfast, especially the hearty northern soup called pho (pronounced FA-oh), a rich beef broth that is poured hot over rice noodles and paper-thin slices of raw beef and garnished with chopped green onions, coriander and nuoc mam.  A meal in itself, pho used to be, and probably still is, a great favorite for a stand-up breakfast in the market soup stalls of Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City. In New York, the pho served at the Viet Huong at 64 East Broadway is especially good. On the menu it is listed as ''pho bo (tai, nam, gan beo).''  Banh trang, nuoc mam and other Vietnamese ingredients, such as tuong, a sweet bean sauce served with nem nuong, and tamarind to flavor the delightfully light sour soups called canh chua, may be purchased at a number of grocery shops in Chinatown, such as Hoa Thanh at 218 Canal Street, the Southeast Asia Trading Company, 68A Mott Street, and Thuan-Nguyen at 82 Mulberry Street.  On Sunday mornings, Vietnamese from all over the New York area do their weekly shopping at Thuan- Nguyen for chilis and lemon grass, varieties of rice noodles and soft rice wrappers, pork and chicken p,ates either steamed (cha lua) or fried (cha chien) and wrapped in banana leaves; sour pork sausages called nem, and soft little cakes of sticky rice with sweet yellow bean paste inside, as well as Vietnamese paperbacks and popular music on cassettes.  Wynn's Ba-Nam - the restaurant is named for Mr. Wynn's wife, an engagingly shy woman who speaks little English but quickly communicates her enthusiasm for the dishes of her native country - is apparently the only eating place in the metropolitan area operated by Vietnamese rather than by ethnic Chinese from Vietnam.  The Saigon Restaurant is run by Sang Dao. Her husband, Quang Li, and nine children, ranging in age from 9 to 27, help out, waiting on tables, chopping vegetables, cheerfully translating and explaining the dishes. With the most recent arrival, Chef Huy, in the kitchen, they prepare and serve a traditional Vietnamese menu, except for one or two Chinese dishes, perhaps as a concession to their Chinatown location.  The Daos and their chef are all ethnic Chinese whose families lived in Cho Lon, the Chinese section of Saigon, for several generations. To this Western observer, as well as to a Vietnamese photographer, dishes like steamed banh cuon (pork-stuffed noodles), ga xao xa (chicken with lemon grass), eel soup with tamarind broth and fresh pineapple, and banh tap (spiced pork on shrimp crackers) seemed to be authentically Vietnamese, and very good.  Concessions are made for American tastes. Kenneth Dao, enthusiastically translating for the Saigon's chef, explained.  ''This sauce,'' he said, indicating the bowl of nuoc cham on the table, ''should really taste stronger and spicier, but we're not quite sure if the American customer can eat it or not. The Vietnamese, they love very much strong food and strong smell, but the American - well, we like it saltier and you like it sweetier. That's the real difference.''  Bach Ngo's Pho (Hanoi Beef Soup)  9cups water  1 1/2pounds oxtail, chopped into  2-inch pieces, or 2 pounds of beef  bones  1pound beef chuck, in 1 piece  12-inch piece fresh ginger  3shallots  2star anise  1stick cinnamon     1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander   1/4cup chopped green scallion tops  1large onion  4ounces bean sprouts   1/2pound beef shoulder roast or  round, in 1 piece   1/2pound rice stick noodles, banh  pho (see note)   1/4cup nuoc mam (see note)  1lemon, cut in 8 wedges   1/2tiny hot red or green chili pepper, sliced thinly.  1.*Bring 9 cups of water to a boil. Add oxtail and chuck. Return to boil for 10 minutes, removing scum. Impale the ginger on a fork and hold it over a flame until it is blackened. Do the same with shallots. Add both to broth, together with star anise and cinnamon. Cover and simmer gently for 3 hours.  2.*While soup is simmering, chop coriander and scallions and combine. Set aside. Slice onion paper thin and set aside.  3.*Blanch bean sprouts in boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove and drain.  4.*Slice round or shoulder roast into paper-thin slices. This will be easier to do if the meat has first been slightly frozen.  5.*About 20 minutes before serving, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil and add rice noodles. Boil 5 minutes, then drain, run cold water over them and set aside.  6.*When broth is done and chuck and oxtail are tender, remove meats from broth. Slice chuck and remove meat from oxtail bones. Remove ginger, shallots, anise and cinnamon from the broth. Add nuoc mam to broth.  7.*To assemble and serve the soup, set out a bowl for each guest. Distribute noodles, cooked meat, and raw meat slices among the bowls. Add a few sliced onions, a few bean sprouts, and sprinkle with the combined scallion and coriander.  8.*Immediately before serving, pour boiling beef broth over the contents of each bowl. This will slightly cook the raw beef.  9.*Serve accompanied by a platter with the remaining bean sprouts and onion rings, the lemon wedges and the hot pepper slices. Serve additional nuoc mam for those who prefer a saltier taste.  Yield: 8 servings.  NOTE: Vietnamese ingredients called for in these recipes are available at Hoa Thanh, 218 Canal Street; the Southeast Asia Trading Company, 68A Mott Street, and Thuan- Nguyen, 82 Mulberry Street.  The following recipes will serve 4, 6 or 8 people, depending on how many dishes are presented at one meal.  Nuoc Cham This is the basic sauce that almost always appears on the Vietnamese table, where it serves somewhat the same function as salt and pepper in the West. Nuoc cham is frequently presented in individual saucers and diners dip their food in the sauce before eating it.  10tablespoons nuoc mam  4tablespoons sugar  2lemons  1tablespoon finely minced garlic    Water to taste  3tiny hot green or red chili peppers, thinly sliced.  1.*In a 4-cup measuring jug, place the nuoc mam, sugar and the juice of the lemons. Mix well until the sugar has dissolved.  2.*Add garlic and stir to mix.  3.*Note the quantity of liquid in the measuring jug and add one and a half times that amount in water. Stir well and taste. You may add more of any ingredient. The nuoc cham should have a delicately fishy flavor, sweet and tart at the same time.  4.*Add chili peppers.  NOTE: The sauce can be made ahead of time and stored in a tightly covered jar in the refrigerator for two to three months.  Ba-Nam's Cha Gio   1/2 cup dried shrimp, if desired  10tree ear or black fungus mushrooms  1stick (approximately 2 ounces)  bean thread or cellophane noodles   1/2pound cooked crabmeat  1pound lean pork, ground  1cup coarsely grated carrot, if  desired   3/4cup chopped onion  2teaspoons finely minced garlic   1/2teaspoon ground black pepper   1/2teaspoon cornstarch if necessary  1package banh trang rice papers  2to 3 cups peanut or corn oil.  For serving:  1head Boston lettuce, washed and  separated into leaves  1cucumber, unpeeled, sliced very  thin  1medium carrot, coarsely grated  1bunch coriander  1bunch mint  1cup nuoc cham.  1.*Put dried shrimp in a small bowl and cover to a depth of 1 inch with warm water. Set aside to soak for 30 minutes. Do the same with the mushrooms and noodles.  2.*Pick over and shred crabmeat, removing shell and cartilage.  3. Mix crabmeat and pork together in a large bowl. Add carrot, onion, garlic and black pepper, mixing well with your hands.  4.*Drain shrimp, chop coarsely and add to pork mixture.  5.*Drain mushrooms well, slice thinly and add to pork.  6.*Drain noodles, squeezing to remove all water. Chop into pieces no more than 1 inch in length and add to pork.  7.*Using your hands, mix everything together very well. Ba-Nam adds a little cornstarch if the mixture does not seem to adhere. When well mixed, set aside for 15 minutes.  8.*Take a deep pie plate into which a rice paper will fit comfortably and fill it with hot water. Dip a rice paper in water to soften it and spread it gently on a clean dry surface such as a cutting board. Put about 3 tablespoons of pork mixture, roughly shaped like a fat cigar, on the edge of the rice paper nearest you. Flip that edge over pork, then fold sides of rice paper toward center over the stuffing. Roll up securely. The damp rice paper will adhere to itself. You should have a firm and compact roll. Set aside on a plate and proceed with the rest of the rice papers.  The cha gio may be prepared ahead of time up to this point but if you are going to keep them longer than 15 minutes or so, cover the plate with a dampened towel and refrigerate.  9.*To serve, arrange lettuce, cucumber and carrot attractively on a plate. Wash coriander and mint and remove thick stems. Arrange on the plate. Have a small saucer or bowl of nuoc cham at each place setting.  10.*Heat 2 cups of oil to the point that a bread cube browns quickly and rises to the surface. (A wok is preferable but a sauce pan with high sides will do. The oil should be at a depth of about 2 1/2 inches.) Add cha gio to hot oil, a few at a time, and fry until golden brown. Remove and drain on absorbent paper.  11.*Serve cha gio on a bed of lettuce. (If they are large, cut into 2 or 3 pieces.) Pass vegetable plate separately. Each diner takes a lettuce leaf and rolls it around a cha gio, adding mint, coriander and so on as desired. Dip into nuoc cham before eating and in between bites.  NOTE: If smaller cha gio are preferred, cut rice paper circles into quarters after softening. Rice paper in smaller sizes can occasionally be found.  Ba-Nam's Nem Nuong  With Nuoc Leo Sauce  2ounces pork fat  1pound lean pork  1teaspoon sugar  1teaspoon finely minced garlic   1/2teaspoon ground black pepper  2to 3 tablespoons peanut oil  For sauce:  2tablespoons tuong  2tablespoons water  2tiny hot green or red chili peppers   1/2cup unsalted peanuts, finely  chopped  To serve:  1package banh trang rice papers  1cucumber, unpeeled, thinly  sliced  1bunch mint, thick stems removed  1bunch coriander, thick stems removed  1head Boston lettuce, leaves  separated.  1.*Have butcher grind pork and pork fat together very fine, or do it yourself in a food processor. Mix sugar, garlic and pepper with pork and set aside, covered and refrigerated, for a few hours or overnight.  2.*Make the sauce: Combine tuong and water and mix well. Add thinly sliced chili peppers to taste. Place sauce in serving bowl and sprinkle peanuts over top.  3.*When ready to serve, form pork into little meatballs about 1 inch in diameter and thread onto wooden skewers. Grill over charcoal if possible, basting frequently with peanut oil; or broil in a gas or electric oven for 15 to 20 minutes, basting and turning skewers until meatballs are nicely browned.  4.*While meat is cooking, arrange vegetables on platter with rice papers and a bowl of warm water.  5.*To serve: Each guest should dip a rice paper in water to soften, then arrange lettuce on rice paper with other vegetables as desired and two or three meatballs. Wrap rice paper to make a little package and dip in nuoc leo sauce before eating.  Chef Huy's Banh Tap (Spiced pork on shrimp crackers)   1/2pound lean pork, slightly frozen  (for easier slicing)  2stalks lemon grass  1tablespoon sugar  1tablespoon nuoc mam  1tablespoon finely minced garlic  5tablespoons peanut oil  1dozen prawn crackers (kroepoek)  2cups peanut or corn oil for deep  frying  3scallions, green and white parts,  finely sliced (about 1/4 cup)  3tablespoons unsalted peanuts,  finely chopped.  1.*Slice the pork as thinly as you can, cut each slice in half and place in a deep bowl.  2.*Peel the rough outside husks off the lemon grass and chop the tender inside very finely. Add to pork.  3.*Add sugar, nuoc mam, garlic and 2 tablespoons of oil to pork, mix well, cover and refrigerate for several hours or overnight.  4.*When ready to serve, heat 2 cups of oil to the point that a bread cube browns quickly and rises to surface. Lower heat and drop in a prawn cracker. If the oil is hot enough (it should be just below the smoking point), the cracker will puff and swell and rise almost immediately to the surface. Remove and drain on absorbent paper. Proceed with rest of prawn crackers. The crackers must be removed as soon as they have fully expanded or they will curl up too tightly to spread the pork on them. This sounds complicated; in fact, it's a lot of fun.  5.*In a wok or frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil and saute scallions over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until brown. Remove, drain on absorbent paper, and set aside.  6.*Add 1 tablespoon oil to pan. Raise heat and saute pork over high heat until brown. Remove, leaving behind as much oil as possible.  7.*To serve, arrange shrimp crackers on platter. Top each cracker with a few slices of spicy pork and garnish each cracker with browned scallions and chopped peanuts.  Chef Huy's Chicken With Lemon Grass  3chicken legs (including thighs)  2stalks lemon grass  2tablespoons peanut oil   1/2cup chicken broth  1tablespoon sugar  1tablespoon nuoc mam   1/4teaspoon ground black pepper  1tablespoon thick soy sauce  1tablespoon honey  1teaspoon sesame oil.  1.*Skin and bone chicken legs and cut meat into bite-size pieces.  2.*Remove rough outer husk from lemon grass and chop until very fine.  3.*Heat oil in wok and add chicken. Saute quickly over high heat just to brown. Add broth, sugar, nuoc mam, pepper and soy sauce and continue cooking over high heat until broth has almost evaporated.  4.*Add honey and mix well. Turn chicken pieces in honey, then add lemon grass and mix very well. Continue to cook, stirring continuously for 30 seconds longer.  5.*Just before serving, remove pan from heat and add sesame oil. Mix well and turn onto serving platter.  Ca Chien Sot Ca (Fried fish with tomato sauce)  Adapted from ''The Classic Cuisine of Vietnam'' by Bach Ngo  and Gloria Zimmerman.  1clove garlic  1scallion, white part only  1medium ripe tomato  2tablespoons nuoc mam  2teaspoons sugar   1/4teaspoon ground black pepper  1pound halibut steak, about 1 inch  thick   1/4cup peanut or corn oil  2tablespoons chopped green coriander.  1.*Slice garlic and scallion paper- thin and set aside. Peel and seed tomato and cut into dice. Combine nuoc mam, sugar and pepper and set aside.  2.*Cut fish into 2 pieces if necessary and dry well with paper towels. Heat oil in frying pan and add fish. Cook over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes per side, or until fish is cooked through. Remove to a heated platter.  3.*Remove all but 2 teaspoons oil from pan. In remaining oil, over medium heat, saute garlic and scallion, stirring frequently, until brown. Add diced tomato and stir. Then add nuoc mam mixture, turn heat to medium high and boil, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. When sauce is cooked, pour over fish on platter. Sprinkle with chopped coriander before serving.  AN excellent introduction  to Vietnamese food is ''The Classic Cuisine of Vietnam'' (Barron's, $17.95) by Bach Ngo and Gloria Zimmerman.  Like many Vietnamese, Bach Ngo left Saigon in the waning days of April 1975. She had 30 minutes in which to collect her children and pack her bags. In the confusion, she says, laughing now at the recollection, what she packed in her suitcase was not her husband's clothes but her considerable collection of recipes.  What might have been a minor tragedy turned out to be a major triumph, for with the collection she was able to compile the cookbook and eventually to open a restaurant, Chez Bach, in Branford on the Connecticut shore.

"      A White House aide met this week with Vietnam's Foreign Minister to discuss details on how to carry out the Administration's offer to accept tens of thousands of Vietnamese immigrants, State Department officials said today.  The United States has said that it is prepared to take in all of the Asian- American children in Vietnam and 10,000 of the current and former prisoners from its re-education camps.  The meeting between Nguyen Co Thach, the Foreign Minister, and Richard Childress, an Indochina specialist on the National Security Council staff, was said to have taken place Tuesday in New York, where Mr. Thach is attending the United Nations General Assembly session.  Details of the session were sketchy, but a State Department official said that the meeting ''continued the progress'' made when a senior State Department refugee official, Robert L. Funseth, met with the Vietnamese in Geneva earlier in the month.  Last month, Secretary of State George P. Shultz announced that the United States was ready to accept all the so-called Amerasian children in Vietnam. Most of the children, whose number has been estimated at from 8,000 to 15,000, were fathered by American servicemen in the Vietnam War. Mr. Shultz also said that the United States was prepared to accept 10,000 of the re-education camp prisoners over several years.  The Vietnamese have said that they are prepared to let all the children leave, and want the United States to agree to accept all the re-education camp inmates. The United States has wanted the children and the inmates to be admitted through procedures involving the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, but the Vietnamese have preferred to deal directly with the United States.

"   , Ga., Oct. 19   A Vietnamese refugee who gave a United States citizen a list of nine soldiers he said were held in Southeast Asia apparently fabricated the story to get access to this country, officials said today.  The list included Capt. David J. Phillips, whose wife, Peggy, was notified by Air Force officials Sunday her husband might still be alive after 18 years.  On Thursday, an Air Force spokesman telephoned Mrs. Phillips at her home here, told her the list was a fabrication and apologized.  The refugee, who fled Vietnam in April 1982, initially told interviewers in Thailand he had no information, according to Ann Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families in Washington.  After being denied access to the United States, the refugee responded to an advertisement placed in a Vietnamese newspaper seeking information.

"      China indirectly criticized the Soviet Union today for its support of the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. The move came as Soviet negotiators held talks here on ways to improve their troubled relations.  An analysis of recent Vietnamese actions on the Cambodian issue published by the official New China News Agency today did not mention Moscow, but China has consistently said Moscow's close ties with Hanoi encouraged Hanoi's occupation of Cambodia and threatened to disrupt the Pacific region.  The timing of the commentary to coincide with the current round of normalization talks between China and the Soviet Union made clear that Peking considered Moscow's backing for Hanoi a major block to relations, political analysts said.  The press agency report rejected Hanoi's proposals for talks on Cambodia or discussions between Hanoi and the Peking-backed anti-Vietnamese guerrilla coalition, which includes both Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Khmer Rouge.

"    A witness who said he had recently been a middle-echelon leader of a Vietnamese crime gang in the United States testified at a Federal hearing yesterday that his superior had told him that Nguyen Cao Ky, former Prime Minister and Vice President of South Vietnam, headed a Vietnamese crime organization in this country.  The hooded, unidentified witness spoke before the President's Commission on Organized Crime as it ended three days of hearings in Manhattan on the growth of Asian crime organizations in the United States.  Earlier, the commission staff asserted in a report that Vietnamese gangs operated in 13 states, including New York, Pennsylvania and California, and mainly victimized Vietnamese and Chinese in the United States.  The witness, when questioned by the commission's deputy executive director, Rodney G. Smith, said he had never met Mr. Ky.  'Everyone Should Know'   ''Were you told by a superior that he was the leader?'' Mr. Smith asked.  ''Yes, the information was that everyone should know that Ky was the leader,'' he replied.  Later, he added that in Vietnamese communities in the United States, ''everyone knows'' that Mr. Ky headed the organization.  After the hearing, the commission's chief counsel, James D. Harmon Jr., when asked by a reporter whether the commission had any additional evidence implicating Mr. Ky, said, ''I can't comment beyond what was said in testimony, but as a general reply, wouldn't a member in the Lucchese family know who the boss is?''  He was referring to the Lucchese group, which law enforcement officials contend is one of the five major crime groups in the New York area.  'Most Famous Refugee'   At his home in Huntington Beach, Calif., Mr. Ky said that ''I know nothing about this.'' He said he was being singled out ''because I am the most famous refugee in America.''  ''Of course, I have heard rumors about the activities of these groups, but I know nothing about them,'' he said. Mr. Ky described himself as ''a poor man'' and said that because of recent business setbacks, he had put his $260,000 house up for sale. Mr. Ky, who is 54 years old, has been in exile in California since 1975, when South Vietnam was overrun by North Vietnam.  The witness said the gangs committed murders, robberies and extortion and trafficked in marijuana. Besides Mr. Ky, the witness said former South Vietnamese Army generals and officers were leaders in the organization that controlled the gangs. According to the witness, the gangs justified their crimes by maintaining that they were anti-Communist groups raising money for guerrillas in South Vietnam.  Commission staff members said it was necessary to conceal the background of the former Vietnamese gang member to protect him and his family.  Testifying from behind a screen and with a dozen Federal marshals stationed in the marble-columned hearing room, the witness said he knew of gang operations in the Los Angeles area, San Francisco, Chicago and Houston.  At a training camp in California, he said, he and others were taught how to use guns, including a 9-millimeter semiautomatic machine gun. That gun, which had been provided by the witness, was examined by 7 of the 19 commission members at the hearing in Federal Hall at 26 Wall Street.  The witness said there was a ''boss'' in each state where Vietnamese gangs operated. Each unit, he said, has a leader and an assistant leader. He said he was an assistant leader in one gang. He estimated that nationwide there were about 1,000 members.  Instructions for Killing   At training sessions, he said, recruits were instructed on how to rob Chinese gambling opertions, how to extort money from merchants and ''how to kill.'' Before a murder, he said, members were cautioned to make sure that they had ''backup transportation'' to escape from the crime area and to wear gloves so that no fingerprints would be found on murder weapons.  The commission also heard yesterday about the murder and intimidation of Vietnamese journalists who had written about the gangs in Vietnamese- language newspapers in the United States. A woman who was later identified by staff members as the widow of Dam Phong, described how her husband, a publisher, was slain on Aug. 24, 1982, in Houston.  She said her husband was threatened after he published articles about exortions and frauds committed by a gang. She said that before the slaying, her children received telephone threats instructing them to tell their ''father to stay away from our business or he will be sorry for what he does.''

"      Reagan Administration officials said today that differences within Vietnam's leadership may have delayed a response to an offer by the United States to accept thousands of political prisoners.  Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Sept. 11 that the United States was ready to take up a Vietnamese offer to release the prisoners from ''re-education camps'' to the Americans. In testimony before Congress, he said that over the next two years the United States was ready to take 10,000 prisoners who had ties to the United States or had served in the old South Vietnamese Government, which fell in April 1975. Figures vary, but 10,000 has been cited by Vietnamese authorities.  Mr. Shultz also said that the United States would accept all Asian-American children and their close family members over the next three years. The so-called Amerasians, largely fathered by American soldiers during the Vietnam War, have already been coming to the United States through a United Nations-administered program. Administration officials said that, after Mr. Shultz's speech, they had urged Vietnam to accelerate the processing of children eligible to leave.  Children's Exit Is Slow  Vietnam has said that all Amerasians can leave, and it has said that the United States has been slow in taking them. American officials say Vietnam shares responsibility by not assigning enough personnel to the children's emigration program.  With the children's program continuing, the United States had now begun to focus on the apparent Vietnamese hesitation to allow the departure of the political prisoners, who with their families make up about 30,000 people.  ''From some conversations we have had,'' an American official said, ''we are getting the impression that the security officials in Hanoi are very wary about releasing these prisoners to the United States. From the questions we have been asked there seems to be a worry in Hanoi that these prisoners will be turned into some kind of rebel military force against them, and they are in no rush to let them out.''  In 1982 Foreign Minister Nguyen Cao Thach said Vietnam would release the prisoners if the United States took them in. This was repeated last May, in an interview in Newsweek magazine, by Prime Minister Pham Van Dong.   Pham Van Dong Is Quoted  ''We are quite prepared to allow all of those left in the camps to leave tomorrow for the United States, but the United States Government has rejected that suggestion,'' he said. ''They prefer to leave these criminals free in Vietnam but not in the United States.''  The United States had not rejected the offer, but it was not publicly accepted until Mr. Shultz's testimony on Sept. 11. Since then there have been two meetings with Vietnamese officials to discuss the matter.  On Oct. 4 in Geneva, Robert L. Funseth, a State Department refugee official, met with Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai and outlined specific suggestions.  The United States initially wanted to process the prisoners through the program administered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. But Vietnam wanted the matter dealt with directly by the United States, and Washington agreed.  Another issue raised by the Vietnamese was that the United States must take all the prisoners. Washington wanted to limit the program to those who have had some sort of affiliation with the United States or with the former South Vietnamese Government.  All May Be Eligible  ''We have told the Vietnamese that we have to have a list of who is in the camps and how many there are,'' a State Department official said. ''Who knows, maybe when we see the list it will turn out that everyone would be eligible.''  Richard Childress, the National Security Council expert on Indochina, met with Mr. Thach in New York last month when the Vietnamese Foreign Minister was there for the United Nations General Assembly.  Mr. Thach gave Mr. Childress the impression, a State Department official said, that he was in no hurry to move on the question of the prisoners. He was reported to have expressed concern that the prisoners might take the lead in an insurgency.  This suggested that even though he and Mr. Dong had publicly said all the prisoners could leave, the Vietnamese leadership had not yet reached a final decision.  Mr. Thach indicated that the children's program would continue in any event, and he was urged to speed the procedures.  U.S. Seeks 450 Children a Month  Last month 250 children and their relatives left Ho Chi Minh City for Bangkok, Thailand, on their way to the United States. The United States would like to raise monthly departures to at least 450, a State Department official said.  On the political prisoners, the United States plans to take the initiative if it does not hear soon from Vietnam. Some members of Congress, such as Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of New York, are planning to visit Vietnam by the end of the year, and State Department officials said that by then the Vietnamese would probably decide what to do.  State Department officials say that the talks with the Vietnamese have been limited to refugee matters and to the issue of finally accounting for all the Americans missing in action in the Vietnam War, and have not touched on a resumption of diplomatic relations.

Some of the defendants have been identified as officers of the former South Vietnamese military.

"   , Vietnam, Dec. 23   Vietnam may not agree to release inmates of ''re- education'' camps for resettlement in the United States unless Washington promises to curtail what Hanoi describes as anti-Vietnamese activities among exiles in America, officials here told two American Congressmen this weekend.  The Foreign Ministry statements have raised an unexpected obstacle to a Reagan Administration plan, announced in September by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, to admit 8,000 to 10,000 inmates of the camps. Many of the inmates were imprisoned because of their ties to the United States or the American-backed former Government of South Vietnam.  On Saturday Phan Doan Nam, an assistant to Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, met with the two visiting Congressmen, Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, and Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey and a member of the committee. Mr. Nam told them that ''over the last few months'' Hanoi had concluded that Vietnamese living in the United States and Western Europe were supporting and organizing attacks on Vietnamese abroad and plotting subversion at home.  Four Sentenced to Death   In Ho Chi Minh City last week Vietnam tried 21 people and sentenced four of them to death for plotting rebellion. Nearly 100 more suspects are reported to be under arrest. Hanoi has charged that they were trained by China and Thailand and that at least some had links with the United States Embassy in Bangkok.  China, Thailand and the United States have denied the allegations.  Today the two Congressmen and their aides met privately with Foreign Minister Thach to discuss a range of issues. Mr. Solarz said after the meeting that Hanoi appeared to be less willing to cooperate with the United States in arranging the resettlement of political prisoners than it was in October, when the two nations met on the subject in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The idea of sending re- education camp inmates to the United States was first proposed by Vietnam.  Hanoi is now saying it wants concrete assurances Washington will curb Vietnamese exiles, Mr. Solarz said. He added that Hanoi sought to curtail not only what it regarded as activities directed against Vietnam, but also attacks ''against our friends in Central America.'' Some Vietnamese-Americans are reported to have joined rebels fighting the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua.  'All Over the United States'   Mr. Nam, who is considered a rising star in Hanoi's Foreign Ministry, said on Saturday that there appeared to be anti-Vietnamese organizations ''all over the United States.''  He said these activists had been responsible for attacks on the Vietnamese Mission to the United Nations in New York and on a Vietnamese writer slain in Los Angeles.  (In Washington, a State Department official said the United States was not aware of any violent attacks on the Vietnamese Mission. He said that there had been demonstrations in recent years but that they had been orderly. The official said he had no details on the possible slaying of a writer.)  ''These people are criminals,'' Mr. Nam said of past and present political prisoners. ''In this case, how can we let them go? It is impossible to hand over weapons to be fired against us.''  Mr. Nam made clear, however, that Hanoi did not believe rebellion within Vietnam was being directed from the American Embassy in Bangkok, despite what he said was evidence of meetings subversives had there with United States diplomats. He and other officials place most of the blame on China.  Hanoi's demands that the United States curb anti-Vietnamese dissent posed problems, Mr. Solarz said, ''because their definition of subversive activities could include anything from writing articles or taking part in demonstrations to sending arms.''  Optimism on Amerasians   He said that while Congress and the American public were strongly in favor of seeing existing laws on illegal activities against foreign governments enforced, Hanoi had to understand that there were certain American freedoms that must be respected.  In talks with the Congressmen this weekend, Hanoi reportedly remained willing to move quickly on another refugee matter, the resettlement in the United States of children fathered by Americans in Vietnam. ''They are already U.S. citizens,'' Mr. Nam said Saturday. ''And you should look after them. We would give them all up in six months.''  Mr. Solarz and Mr. Torricelli are on a six-day visit to Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Mr. Solarz also visited Bhopal, India, to talk to officials about the disaster at the Union Carbide pesticide factory there.  The stop in Cambodia, scheduled for Monday, has brought criticism from members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which does not recognize the Vietnamese-backed Government of Heng Samrin in Phnom Penh. The United States also does not recognize the Phnom Penh Government.  Thailand's Foreign Minister, Siddhi Savetsila, said that the Congressmen's visit to Cambodia ''would send the wrong signal to Hanoi.'' Vietnam has 150,000 to 180,000 troops in Cambodia to support the Government, which it installed in 1979 after invading the country in late 1978 tooverthrow the Government of Pol Pot.  Mr. Solarz has told Vietnamese officials that better ties between Hanoi and the United States, which now have no diplomatic relations, depend on Vietnamese willingness to withdraw from Cambodia. He is going to Phnom Penh, he said, to assess the position of the Government there on various proposals that could lead to Vietnamese withdrawal.     U.S. Hopes for Formal Talks     WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 - State Department officials said today that the United States hoped to have formal talks with Vietnam to gain the release of inmates in re-education camps.  The officials said Vietnam had not yet formally told Washington why it had delayed the release. The United States, one official said, views resettlement of the inmates as a humanitarian gesture with little political cost to Hanoi.  Another official said the Administration could not limit the rights of Vietnamese exiles in this country to call for an end to Communist rule. ''There are obviously free speech guarantees,'' he said. ''If the Vietnamese are worried about advocacy, we wouldn't be able to satisfy them.''  The official added, however, that American laws against arms shipments by private citizens to resistance movements elsewhere could and would be enforced.  Administration officials have been skeptical for several months that Vietnam would follow through on its promise to release the political prisoners held in the camps.

"    Vietnam has earned its reputation as the Prussia of Southeast Asia. After humbling French and American armies, it conquered Laos and Cambodia, then turned ferociously on its subject peoples. This Christmas week, Vietnam mounted a fresh offensive against Cambodian rebels, driving 63,000 more civilians across the border into Thailand.  This dumping of unwanted people was heretically anticipated by Bertolt Brecht, the Communist writer who lived in the real Prussia. When East Berlin's workers rose in vain revolt against their Communist masters in 1953, leaflets were circulated asserting that the people had ''lost the Government's confidence.'' Would it not be simpler, Brecht wondered, ''if the Government dissolved the People and elected another?''  Vietnam has embraced this simpler solution. Wedded to a doctrine that pretends to be scientific, Hanoi applies radical surgery to nonconformists. Among the luckier are the 600,000 Vietnamese who have fled by boat since 1975. Less lucky are the 10,000 rotting in jail because they once worked for Americans. Unluckiest of all are the Cambodians, first beset by Vietnamese guerrillas, then by American bombing, next by the genocidal Communism of Pol Pot, then by famine and finally by a Vietnamese invasion in 1978.  Three million Cambodians have perished in these disasters, roughly a third of the nation. Most of the deaths occurred under successive Communist regimes. An additional 600,000 Cambodians have fled into exile. Yet even after this bloodletting, the client regime installed by Vietnam needs 180,000 troops to protect it from three rebel forces.  To its shame, Vietnam has rejected every proposal for restoring self-determination to an ill-used people. After visiting Hanoi this week, Representatives Steven Solarz and Robert Torricelli detected no willingness even to engage in serious talks about ending the war in Cambodia.  The unavoidable conclusion is that Vietnam wants to elect a new people, in ways described by the Czech historian Milan Hubl: ''The first step to liquidating a people is to erase its memory. Destroy its books, its culture, its history. Then have somebody write new books, manufacture a new culture, invent a new history. Before long the nation will begin to forget what it is and what it was.''  Given that Vietnamese objective, it is surely right to continue helping the non-Communist Cambodian resistance and to help shelter those who flee. But the United States has a further obligation: to work for the release of the 10,000 Vietnamese now in ''re-education camps'' because they once worked for Americans.  Vietnam's Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong, said last May that those outcasts could leave ''tomorrow'' for the United States. Secretary of State Shultz agreed to receive them, but the processing problems drag on. Now Hanoi says that unless Washington curbs anti-Vietnamese activities among exiles it may not release anyone.

"   , Mass., April 16   The Vietnamese call them ''children of the dust.'' They are the despised, mixed- race children of American fathers and Vietnamese mothers, one of the most poignant legacies of the Vietnam War.  And now they are coming over here.  They are beginning to come in significant numbers because the Government of Vietnam, for the first time since the American armed forces pulled out nine years ago, is now pursuing an aggressive policy in cooperation with the United Nations of locating these children and getting rid of them, legally, safely and fast.  About 1,000 mixed-blood children from Vietnam, many half-black, reflecting the predominantly black makeup of American ground forces, have been resettled in the United States so far. Now a hundred Amerasian children are arriving every month, a rate that is accelerating.  Most of the children are coming to the United States with their mothers, who remember names and other facts making it possible to trace the fathers.  For these families, the persistant dream of reunion is fraught with ambiguity and sorrow. Refugee experts say that only a minuscule number of fathers, 2 percent or less, want to see their Vietnamese children again.  There are several reasons for their rejection.  ''Life goes on and other bonds are forged,'' said Leo Dorsey, until recently director of the International Institute of Boston, a refugee agency. ''The men don't want to create problems with their existing families by raising the specter of another woman and children in their background.''  Mr. Dorsey added that many of the relationships between American men and Vietnamese women were ''opportunistic on both sides, not likely to produce feelings of loyalty and commitment.'' Further, he said, ''after the Communists took over in 1975, the mothers feared their association with Americans would cause them to be mistreated, and all communication between them and the U.S. stopped. They also destroyed all documents, including photos, that would prove that connection.''  In one sense, the nine Vietnamese- American children just arrived in this college-rich area around Amherst are lucky. They are orphans and ''unaccompanied minors'' without any known relatives in Vietnam or the United States. Nine to 14 years old, they have come bearing documents such as the following, signed by the Vietnamese Government:  ''Lam, Binh, male, born in Ho Chi Minh City in 1975, is an Asian-American orphan, whose mother and father are dead, unknown, have disappeared and left the child to be raised by the Government of Vietnam.'' They are not being encouraged to believe they will find their fathers, even if the fathers are alive.  But the seven foster families in the Amherst area have greeted their new children with such enthusiasm and love that the nine orphans, at first frightened and untrusting, are beginning to open up like morning glories.  Estimates on Children   How many Amerasian children are left in Vietnam? The best estimate possible from the State Department and refugee agencies is that there are from 8,000 to 10,000 Vietnamese-American children in and around Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, alone. There is no formal count on others in Vietnam's provinces, but John A. Shade Jr., executive director of the Pearl S. Buck Foundation, which has focused entirely on the plight of Amerasian children since 1964, estimates the number in all of South Vietnam at 25,000 to 40,000.  On this side of the world, nearly all of these children, like others before them from previous wars fought by Americans abroad, had been ignored both by the United States Government and the men who fathered them. In October 1982, however, Congress amended the immigration law to recognize Amerasian children as the sons and daughters of American citizens.  Religious and other volunteer agencies are resettling the refugee children all over the country. There are special reasons, however, for the choice of this area in western Massachusetts.  Marlena Brown of Lutheran Child and Family Services, which has resettled this group of Amerasian refugee children and is nationally sharing with the United States Catholic Conference the task of finding foster care, points out that the Amherst area is multiracial, multilingual and tolerant of outsiders. Four of the five colleges around here - the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Mt. Holyoke and Smith - have a total of 65 Vietnamese students able to be big brothers and sisters. There are also numerous, recently settled Vietnamese families.  Dramatic Changes Seen  None of the orphans speak more than a few words of English yet. Most are very tiny for their age because of worms and malnutrition, and all were reared from birth in institutions where life was drab and sometimes harsh. Several weeks in this country, at home and in school, have made a dramatic difference in some of the children.  The group of nine, none of whose members are related, arrived March 26 at the Logan Airport in Boston. David Rosenberger, an official of the Luthern agency, described the scene:  ''There they came, down the tunnel from the plane. They seemed more tattered and neglected than even the Cambodians we had seen in the refugee camps in Thailand. I don't think I ever felt more moved, seeing those kids. They were the people we left behind. Yet they are the true survivors. There is steel in those little bodies.''  Beryl Ohlson, a nurse with five fair- haired children of her own who has also been foster mother for more than a year to a retarded Cambodian boy, said: ''We saw the children all huddled together. We focused in on Yen right away. We couldn't take our eyes off her. She was so absolutely beautiful.''  Her daughters, Anna-Stina, 16, and Kiersten, 12, began opening parkas and peering at the children's name tags inside. When Anna-Stina reached Yen Vu, aged 12, a black, finely featured child of exceptional beauty and verve, she read the name tag and cried: ''It's her! Mom, it's her!'' The mother said, ''I was already in love with Yen.''  This is the first such acceptance these Amerasian children have ever known. The ''children of the dust'' epithet that followed them and those like them of mixed blood back in Saigon was explained by Lucy Nguyen. Mrs. Nguyen fled Vietnam in 1975 with her four daughters, was finally rejoined here by her Vietnamese husband and is now a teacher of French at Amherst College and the Lutherans' bilingual Vietnamese case worker in the Amherst area.  'Children of the Dust'   ''Everyone called them bui doi - children of the dust - worthless, throwaway things,'' she said. ''They were at the mercy of the wind, and of time.''  They were jeered at and discriminated against, she said, not only on racial grounds, but also for political and moral reasons: because Amerasian ''half-breeds'' are vivid, living reminders of the bitterness of the war waged by Americans on Vietnamese soil, and of their long liaisons or fleeting encounters with Vietnamese women. The Vietnam Government has denied that the mixed-blood children are social outcasts, saying that all Vietnamese children have suffered and are victims of war.  But, ''these children are really not wanted by the Vietnamese, who consider them a burden on the state,'' Mrs. Brown of the Lutheran agency insists. ''They all show a lifetime of neglect, emotionally and medically. We chose them at random because we consider all of them to be equally needy. As for the foster parents, we look for people who are flexible, who are problem- solvers and who have, if you will, a world view and would understand children of a different culture.''  Pledge for Long-Term Homes   Almost all of the foster parents have agreed to give the Amherst orphans long-term homes. ''These children are anything but impermanent,'' Mr. Rosenberger said. ''Chances are we will keep them at least until their majority.''  Most of the orphans seemed alert, even fascinated with the goings- on at home and at local schools, where they are learning English but cannot yet participate properly in class. In every case but one, there are biological children already in the foster family.  David Slade's 12-year-old son, Jody, grabbed scrappy little Duong Le, whose age is given as 13 but is about as tall as an 8-year-old, and hugged the Vietnamese boy to him to show the difference in heights. ''Would you believe that Duong is older than me?'' Jody asked, as Duong wriggled out of the embrace.  The other new addition in the little Victorian house of Mr. Slade, who is divorced, is Rang Thach, 14. At first Rang jumped at sudden noises, such as ringing telephones, but he is much less nervous now. He told Mrs. Nguyen that the reason that he had been abandoned and put in an orphanage was because he was black.  'They Want to Participate'   Now he is wreathed in smiles much of the time, directed mainly at his new, white brother and father. ''I'm amazed how he and Duong pitch in to chop things for dinner or clear the table,'' Mr. Slade said. ''They want to participate. My son always has six reasons why he can't do the dishes. And there isn't a thing I've given them that they haven't eaten.''  There have been some problems, such as balkiness at eating a strange diet and fear of needles and other medical paraphernalia in physical examinations.  Barbara Ayers, the guidance counselor at a school in nearby Granby, described the Vietnamese-American orphans as ''much less trusting at first'' than the Cambodian refugee children who came here with their families in the past two years. ''The orphans are more withdrawn, but that's changing already,'' she said. ''After all, they've been institutionalized all their lives. They haven't had the exposure to the outside world the Cambodians have had.''  'Terribly Responsive to Love'   At Beryl Ohlson's house, Yen Vu tumbled about like a puppy, giggling, hugging and kissing her two new sisters, Anna-Stina and Kiersten. Bit by bit, she has moved all her new possessions from her own bedroom into Anna- Stina's bedroom, and now sleeps there. Mrs. Ohlson calls her ''terribly affectionate, terribly responsive to love.''  What would happen, Mrs. Ohlson was asked, if Yen's real father ever showed up? She set her lips. ''I'd meet him at the front door with my lawyer,'' she said. ''Nobody is going to take her away from me.''  She was equally vehement on another point. ''I think every single Amerasian child should be in this country,'' she said. ''I think we owe it to them.''

"      The Vietnamese Government, lacking formal diplomatic ties with the United States, has asked an organization of American veterans of the Vietnam War to visit Hanoi every three months for talks on a variety of issues.  The Reagan Administration says it opposes the plan, but a State Department official indicated it would probably not try to prevent the veterans group from talking to the Vietnamese. The group, the Vietnam Veterans of America, says it will not seek to negotiate on behalf of the United States Government.  The meetings are expected to touch on such subjects as American servicemen still missing in Southeast Asia, the resettlement of children of American servicemen and Vietnamese women from Vietnam to the United States and cultural exchanges. The date of the first meeting has not yet been set.  The arrangement was disclosed as Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, postponed a scheduled meeting with American officials to discuss the question of some 2,490 American servicemen still listed as missing. Mr. Thach said Thursday that the meeting was being delayed ''for technical reasons'' until the middle of May, adding that United States hostility to Vietam was hampering the relationship.  ''A good atmosphere is needed,'' said Mr. Thach.  Invited as Intermediaries  Robert O. Muller, a former United States Marine lieutenant who was wounded in Vietnam in 1969 and is now president of the Vietnam Veterans of America, said in an interview that Mr. Thach and other Vietnamese officials had invited the veterans group to send delegations to Hanoi at least every three months to serve as intermediaries between the two Governments.  The invitation was extended when Mr. Thach met Mr. Muller and six other veterans in Hanoi two weeks ago, Mr. Muller said.  ''They expressed to us many times the desire to work directly with the U.S. Government on issues such as Amerasians and Agent Orange information,'' Mr. Muller said. ''But our Government will not talk to them. So we do represent the only channel with which to exchange information.''  One State Department official, referring to the Vietnamese-backed regime in Cambodia, said the United States ''will not consider normalization of relations with Vietnam as long as it occupies Kampuchea.''  Some Informal Contacts  Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, maintaining that it did so in order to save the country from the atrocities of Mr. Pol Pot's regime. Since then the United States has had some informal contacts with Vietnam, including visits by United States officials and Congressmen as well as veterans to Hanoi.  ''We see our role as providing a bridge to Vietnam, a conduit to dialogue,'' Mr. Muller added. ''The U.S. has expressed to us the desire that we do not conduct these discussions with Vietnam.''  Lyall Breckon, director of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodian affairs at the State Department, who met with some of the veterans on Friday, said, ''As a general principle, in the resolution of the P.O.W. and M.I.A. issue, we believe that Government to Government contacts are the correct way to approach and resolve the issue.''  Another State Department official said the Administration opposed the intercession of the veterans group.  ''We try to consult very closely with Vietnam organizations and the families but we think these issues are best handled through Government channels,'' he said, adding that, as far as he knew, the State Department ''will not stand in the way of the veterans.''  List Issues for Talks  Mr. Muller said the veterans would seek to help deal with such issues as missing servicemen, the acceleration of the resettlement of children of American fathers and Vietnamese mothers, the visit of American scientists studying the effects of the herbicide Agent Orange, which was sprayed by United States forces to defoliate jungle battlefields, as well as cultural exchanges and visits.  In the last two years the United States has sought infrequent official visits to Hanoi, mostly by Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Richard L. Armitage, who has traveled to Hanoi to inquire about Americans missing in action. Mr. Armitage last visited Vietnam in February.  Since the end of the war in 1975, the remains of 88 soldiers have been returned, and the Reagan Administration has not ruled out the possibility that some Americans captured during the war are still alive. The Hanoi Government denies such a possibility.  Mr. Muller said he saw the role of the veterans as ''serving as a backstop, monitoring progress'' as well as lobbying Congress on several issues including the plight of Amerasian children. Mr. Muller pointed out that there are an estimated 25,000 to 40,000 of the children in Vietnam. They are treated as outcasts, but only 1,000 have been resettled so far in the United States.  A key reason for the small number of the children in the United States, Mr. Muller said, was the fact that quota restrictions in the United States had limited their emigration from Vietnam. Mr. Muller said that Vietnamese officials had told him that American officials had suggested that more children would be allowed into the United States if the Vietnamese released a number of prisoners in ''re-education camps'' who had worked for the United States Embassy during the war.  A State Department official said: ''There's absolutely no connection. The Amerasian children are one issue. Another issue is we'd like to see movement on the Vietnamese held in re- education camps to whom we feel a special responsibility. The Vietnamese have so far refused to release people from these camps.''   LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 22 1984 ,2
"   , Thailand, Friday, May 11   Pope John Paul II arrived here Thursday in this overwhelmingly Buddhist country and celebrated mass at a stadium before 45,000 people.  Speaking in his homily of the small number of Roman Catholics in Thailand - 200,000 of almost 50 million people - the Pope said he understood their problems. But Buddhist tradition, he added, ''provides a fertile terrain for the seed of God's word, proclaimed by Jesus Christ, to take root and grow.''  Vatican sources who are expert on Southeast Asia said, however, that the Pope's visit to Thailand, due to end tonight, had a purpose not confined to the country's borders. They said the Pope wanted to register the Church's concern over the fate of the Catholic faith in Vietnam, where about 3 million of the country's more than 50 million people are said to be Catholics.  The informants said the Vatican feared the Vietnamese authorities were trying to create a national church separated from Rome and dominated by the Communist Government.  A Message in French  To mark this concern, they said, the Pope recorded a message of encouragement in French to the Vietnamese Catholics, to be broadcast today from the Radio Veritas station in Manila. In it, the Pope is said to exhort them to remain close to their bishops.  Also today, John Paul II visited the Phanat Nikhom refugee camp, the main one for Indochinese refugees in the Bangkok area. The sources said he would stress to them and later to diplomats accredited here that there is need for asylum for those who escape from Indochina.  When the Pope visited the Philippines in 1981, Vietnam urged the Vatican not to visit a refugee camp. John Paul's insistence on making the visit was said to mark a major stage in the deterioration in relations and, according to Vatican sources, led to increased pressure on Vietnamese Catholics.  The step that aroused the Vatican's present sense of crisis was the creation last November of a so-called Patriotic Catholic Committee in Hanoi. In name and apparent aim, the sources said, it recalled the ''patriotic church'' in China, which rejects Rome's authority.  Hierarchy Reacts Strongly  Information reaching the Vatican was said to suggest that the church hierarchy in Vietnam was reacting strongly and had brought about the formal withdrawal from the committee of many of the 142 priests who had been listed as members.  Others were reported to have assured their bishops that they joined under duress and would not be active in the group. The sources estimated that only 20 priests were active members.  Bishop Nguyen Huy Mai of Ban Me Thuot reportedly ordered those of his priests who attended the founding meeting to resign. When they obeyed it was reported that the Bishop was summoned by the authorities and threatened with being prevented from traveling within his Central Highlands diocese if he interfered with committee membership.  In Hue, Archbishop Nguyen Kim Dien is said to have suspended from his functions the only priest of the diocese active in the committee, the Rev. Nguyen Van Binh. The Archbishop has reportedly been severely attacked in the official press and broadcasts. Bishop Nguyen Van Lan of Xuan Loc is said to have admonished his priests who went to Hanoi and forbade them to continue on the committee.  Interrogation by Government  The Government has shown its determination to strike back by calling in for sustained interrogation the bishops and priests who resist the ''patriotic committee.'' Church sources said all interrogations were marked by insults to the Pope and those obeying him.  Before celebrating mass at the national stadium here Thursday, the Pope called on leading Thai Buddhist figures, including King Phumiphol Aduldet.  Thailand is the last stop of the four- nation Far Eastern tour that the Pope began on May 3 in South Korea and that also took him to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. He is due leave Bangkok for Rome tonight shortly before midnight.   LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: photo of Pope John Paul IIand Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn                      ",May 11 1984 ,0
"    To the Editor:  Michiko Kakutani's essay on ''Novelists and Vietnam: The War Goes On'' (April 15) discussed some shortcomings of American novels and other books on Vietnam but left out the main one - the fact that the Vietnamese tend to be shadowy figures in the background of such books.  The war was fought in Vietnam by Vietnamese. We didn't lose it; the North Vietnamese won it. The war did shake us up a bit, but the people who really got shaken up were the Vietnamese. They'll never be the same.  The shadowy place of the Vietnamese in most American books about the Vietnam War does accurately, if inadvertently, reflect their indistinct place in the minds of American soldiers, top brass, diplomats and correspondents alike. Much, indeed, remains to be written about the war, but it looks as though it will have to be written by Vietnamese. Only they would have the kind of perspective to put us in our place.

"      Officials of the Central Intelligence Agency concluded in 1966 and 1967 that United States bombing in North Vietnam was not only ineffective but also left the North Vietnamese with more transport and other military assets than they had before the bombs began to fall.  The C.I.A. analysts came to believe that the Communists in both North Vietnam and South Vietnam were not suffering manpower or supply losses at a rate that would compel them to negotiate to end the war.  These conclusions were in C.I.A. reports, now declassified, that have come to light during the pretrial period of a libel suit filed by Gen. William C. Westmoreland, commander of American forces in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968.  General Westmoreland, now retired, contends that CBS News defamed him in a 1982 documentary that said he had conspired to withhold intelligence estimates indicating an increase in enemy forces in South Vietnam.  Commissioned by McNamara  Among the documents are two informally called McNamara 1 and McNamara 2. According to depositions by George A. Carver, who was special assistant to the Director of Central Intelligence for Vietnamese affairs, the reports were commissioned by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara.  The first was distributed in the Government in August 1966 and the second in May 1967. Both were top secret.  A Special National Intelligence Estimate, published later in 1967 for officials cleared for secrets, was somewhat more optimistic, but not much.  In his deposition Mr. McNamara, who left the Defense Department in late February 1968, said he wanted to have an independent analysis by the C.I.A. on the Communists' ability to continue the war.  The C.I.A. reports, covering hundreds of pages, were by no means optimistic. They had a tone of cold intellectual skepticism.  One, written in 1967, said that ''27 months of bombing of North Vietnam have had remarkably little effect on Hanoi's overall strategy in prosecuting the war, on its confident view of long- term Communist prospects and on its political tactics regarding negotiations.''  Some American policymakers, notably Walt W. Rostow, White House national security adviser, felt that North Vietnam would be coerced into ending the war by fear its industry might be destroyed.  The C.I.A., however, said that while electricity generating plants had suffered significant damage, transportation, oil and lubricant resources ''remain as high as they were when the bombing program started.''  President Lyndon B. Johnson's Administration saw three purposes in the bombing, according to the C.I.A. studies: to improve morale in South Vietnam, to interrupt the flow of men and supplies from North Vietnam to South Vietnam, and to intimidate North Vietnam so it would negotiate an end to the war.  The C.I.A. studies suggest that only the first goal, that of improved morale, was ever achieved.  Saying the bombing program in the North, known as ''Rolling Thunder,'' had not hurt Vietnamese military abilities, the authors added: ''These capabilities have, in fact, been greatly expanded through large infusions of military aid from the U.S.S.R. and Communist China.''  These views were not unknown in South Vietnam. One intelligence officer contended that every time ''we hit a bridge, they repair the bridge and build two bypass bridges - and end up with three times as many bridges as before we started bombing.''  ''Everybody had a lovely time - us bombing and them rebuilding - and everybody got a lot of medals,'' he said recently.  The C.I.A. reports took much the same view, with one saying the ''flow of aid far surpasses the total damage resulting from air attacks.''    Futile Air Attacks by U.S.  On the basis of aerial photography, observations by infiltrated non-American trail watchers and other intelligence, the agency estimated North Vietnam had only about 11,000 to 12,000 trucks, many of them devoted to moving supplies south through Laos on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  The agency added that transport was ''not significantly affected'' by the bombing.  It came to nearly identical conclusions about the futility of attacks on North Vietnamese fighter airfields and Soviet-made SAM-2 antiaircraft missiles. By May 7, 1967, the C.I.A. said, more than 2,250 SAM's had been fired at American aircraft, resulting in 43 confirmed kills and 12 probable kills, as well as the downing of 29 unmanned reconnaissance craft.  One of the most riveting passages in the 1967 report involved casualties, including civilian casualties, from the air war. Some early foreign visitors to North Vietnam, including journalists and others, were sternly criticized in the United States for what was called their naive acceptance of North Vietnamese casualty statistics.  The C.I.A. report essentially confirmed the North Vietnamese figures. It said the monthly air casualty rate in the North - ''heavily weighted with civilians'' - had gone from 2,200 a month in 1966 to 2,800 a month in early 1967. It said there could ''conceivably be large margins of error'' in such figures, but added:  ''Two recent reports, however, make us reasonably confident that our estimates are of the right order of magnitude. The first report, a detailed statement from Hanoi, 'Report of U.S. War Crimes in Nam Dinh City,' released a number of statistics and allegations'' of bombing in 1965 and 1966.  ''The information presented in this report,'' the C.I.A. said, ''seemed to be accurate when measured against detailed studies made on the base of poststrike photography and the casualties claimed by the North Vietnamese were also consistent with independent casualty estimates made by this Agency, using Nam Dinh as a pilot project.''  Dubious Prospects of Victory  But total casualties by early 1967 were not high, the agency said, running in the vicinity of 19,000 to 20,000 people. ''The outlook for marked success in achieving the current objectives of U.S. bombing programs is not bright,'' the C.I.A. said. ''Not within memory,'' the 1967 report said, had the United States faced a problem so difficult with so little foreign support. It added that the problem grew from the prolonged nature of the war and dubious prospects.  ''The longer the war lasts, the more intractable our problems will become,'' it added.  Other documents, some C.I.A. and others military or diplomatic, offer insights into the conduct of the war. For instance, it has become a common argument by many military men and some officials that the Vietnamese Communists suffered a devastating military defeat in the Tet offensive, which began Jan. 30, 1968.  However, a document called ''C.I.A. 349 of April 1968,'' showed little change in the agency estimates of enemy strength after two months of fighting. The Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, estimated the enemy had suffered a net loss from 12,000 to 27,000 men, a serious but perhaps not crushing loss. The military believed that 80,000 enemy troops had been killed in the offensive, but agreed that recruiting and other means had replaced many of those losses.

"    PENH, Cambodia, July 1   A senior Vietnamese official says continuing United States unfriendliness toward Vietnam after a war that ravaged the civilian population has hurt Hanoi's efforts to get villagers to cooperate in searching for missing Americans.

Now the Americans are not friendly to us. How can we get the people's support?''

"    To the Editor:   In the second half of August 1974, Congress drastically slashed military assistance to South Vietnam after the Senate, by a two-vote margin, had defeated a move to eliminate such aid entirely.  As charge d'affaires at the American Embassy in Saigon, I had sent a message to Washington on Aug. 13 warning that a drastic cut in aid, in addition to military consequences, would be interpreted as intent by the U.S. to disengage completely and would very likely precipitate a decision by the North Vietnamese to resume massive military operations, with a view to a military breakthrough in the spring of 1975.  Subsequent statements by the North Vietnamese (such as Gen. Van Tien Dung, Hanoi's military commander) confirmed that their appraisal of Congressional sentiment and of the Watergate-induced impotence of the American Presidency led to the decision in September of 1974 to initiate an all-out military attack against the South in early 1975.  The legacy of what is now history consists of Soviet military installations along the South China Sea, an endless stream of refugees, creeping Vietnamese annexation of Cambodia and more to come.  This June, with House Speaker O'Neill in the vanguard, Congress ended U.S. support for the Nicaraguan ''contras.'' Capitol Hill has signaled to the Communist junta in Managua, to Havana and to Moscow that, short of direct U.S. military intervention (an agonizing step for any administration), the United States is disinclined to prevent consolidation of a Cuban- model, Communist totalitarian regime in Nicaragua. It has also undercut the already slim chances that negotiations might produce results compatible with U.S. national interests.  In the decade from 1974 to 1984, Congress has learned absolutely nothing.

"   , Vietnam, July 17   Vietnam turned over bones believed to be those of eight American servicemen today.  The bones, packed in separate wooden crates, were checked briefly at Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport by United States specialists and loaded onto an Air Force cargo plane for transport to a military identification center in Hawaii.  Officials from both countries said they would soon resume quarterly technical meetings to discuss Americans listed as missing in action in the Vietnam War.  Richard Stevenson, a public affairs officer with the United States Pacific Command, said the talks would probably resume by the end of August. They were interrupted last year by Vietnam, which was angry over American criticism that Hanoi was dragging its feet on the issue.  Hanoi has previously returned the remains of 88 Americans.

"    To the Editor:   Your July 6 news story ''Shultz Seeks to Assure Asians on China Arms'' erred in stating that the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and the United States have agreed not to establish diplomatic relations or provide assistance to Vietnam until it accepts a plan for pulling its troops out of Cambodia and having internationally supervised elections.''  Of the six Asean members, five (Indochina, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore) maintain diplomatic relations with Vietnam and, except for Singapore, have embassies in Hanoi. They maintain a dialogue (however erratic) on the Cambodian problem with Hanoi's leaders.  After almost six years of unyielding Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, the case has not been convincingly made that freezing the United States out of a diplomatic relationship with Vietnam will further Asean's (and Washington's) goal of an independent Cambodia.  Why can't the United States be a strong advocate where it counts - in Hanoi - and, at the same time, drive a wedge into the Soviets' threatening military buildup in Vietnam by offering Hanoi an alternative? With a presence in Hanoi, U.S. officials also would be in a better position to gather information about the almost 2,500 American servicemen still listed as missing in action.  You also reported that some Asean countries ''have urged Washington to provide the Sihanouk and Son Sann forces with military equipment or cash to buy arms.'' Washington's public position is that it will provide only humanitarian aid to the Cambodian refugees inside Thailand and political support for Cambodia's resistance coalition government seated at the United Nations.  However, reports are beginning to surface that the United States already may be funneling direct covert aid (probably cash payments) to the Sihanouk and Son Sann forces (see Far Eastern Economic Review, June 28, p.16). If such reports prove accurate, and if Asean prevails upon Secretary Shultz during their consultations in Jakarta this month, there is a danger that the United States will increasingly resort to covert military assistance instead of diplomatic initiatives ( a la Nicaragua) to underpin its foreign policy in Indochina.

"      Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that the Hanoi Government had agreed to meet again next month on the issue of the nearly 2,500 Americans unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.  He made the disclosure in a speech to the Honolulu Council on Foreign Relations. Mr. Shultz arrived on Tuesday at the end of a 10-day trip to Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.  On Tuesday, Vietnam handed over the remains of what it believed to be eight Americans, and they arrived today at Hickam Air Force Base here from Manila. A special armed forces center here will try to confirm the tentative identifications.  The technical talks with Vietnam on the possible whereabouts of the 2,490 still listed as missing, most of them now believed dead, began in mid-1982 and were to be held every three months.  Talks Were Suspended in '83  But after a session in June 1983, the Vietnamese canceled further meetings after being criticized by the United States Government and by the National League of P.O.W.-M.I.A. Families, which will hold its annual meeting in Washington this weekend to discuss the issue of possible remaining prisoners of war and missing in action.  Aides to Mr. Shultz said about half the missing were believed to have been killed in action. In those cases, where planes were seen crashing, a military aide said, there is no expectation of anything more than receiving the remains if the Vietnamese were to cooperate by sending search teams to areas where the United States knows the planes crashed.  The aide said there were 400 to 500 Americans on which ''a reasonable effort by the Vietnamese ought to come up with positive results.''  An area of particular concern involves 50 to 60 Americans who were photographed alive in Vietnam after being captured or were seen alive soon after falling into Vietnamese hands. The Vietnamese have provided no information on them.  150 'Live Sightings' Reported  In addition, aides said, there have been 150 ''live sightings.'' These sightings, often reported by Vietnamese refugees, are unverified accounts of Vietnamese seeing unidentified whites in remote areas. These purported sightings have generated periodic rumors that some Americans might still be alive in Vietnam.  Aides to Mr. Shultz said that, while it could not be definitively ruled out that some Americans might be alive, there was no supporting evidence to indicate that there were any.  By 1979, the Vietnamese said every living American had been returned. But then came the repatriation of Pfc. Robert R. Garwood of the Marines, who had stayed behind, and his case cast doubt on Vietnam's assurances.  An aide said 17 full-time analysts in the Defense Intelligence Agency keep track of the missing-in-action category and of reports of possible sightings.  Two Criteria for Hanoi Ties  The United States has said that it will not establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam until two criteria are met: All the missing in action must be accounted for, and Vietnam must agree to an acceptable formula for removing its 160,000 troops from Cambodia.  In the Honolulu speech, Mr. Shultz reflected the Reagan Administration's view that Asia was the area offering the most opportunity in the future for American policy makers.  Noting American economic interests and diplomatic efforts in the region, he put particular stress on the need for a strong United States military presence. He said there was ''an enormous concentration of military power'' by nations unfriendly to the United States and its allies. He mentioned Vietnam, North Korea and the Soviet Union.  As to the question of military cooperation with China, an issue he found to be sensitive to Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia that are concerned about possible Chinese expansionism, Mr. Shultz said:  ''Careful discussions have begun on ways in which American technology and equipment might better enable China to counter Soviet military intimidation. This is an important development, but it is also an area where we give careful consideration to the concerns of our allies and other friends in the region.''

"      President Reagan said today that Laos had agreed to allow United States officials to excavate a site to search for the remains of 13 American servicemen whose plane crashed there nearly 12 years ago.  Mr. Reagan made the disclosure during a ceremony at the White House in honor of National P.O.W./M.I.A. Recognition Day. At the ceremony, the President said the Administration was determined to recover the remains and press for information on 2,489 Americans unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, as well as 8,177 from the Korean War.  About 600 of the 2,489 were reported dead or missing in Laos. The Vientiane Government met with American officials last year and allowed a technical team to visit the crash site, near the city of Pakse.    Maintained Diplomatic Ties  The United States, which severed diplomatic relations with Vietnam and Cambodia after the Communist takeovers there in 1975, has maintained diplomatic relations with Laos, but has said ties could not be improved until the missing-in-action issue was resolved.  Today, Mr. Reagan said Laos ''seems to have gained a greater understanding of the importance to us of the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue.''  ''We, in return, have gained a greater understanding of their feelings and problems,'' he said. ''This process has led us to discussions of joint crash site searches.''    'Working Out the Details'  ''And in this regard, I want to pass on some good news to you,'' he said. ''Late last night, we were informed by the Government of Laos of official agreement in principle to excavation of a U.S. crash site. We're working out the details now. We welcome this cooperative gesture.''  A Defense Department spokesman said Mr. Reagan was referring to an Air Force gunship that exploded in midair on Dec. 21, 1972, near Pakse, with 16 men aboard. Two parachuted to safety, and one body was found the next day.  At the ceremony today, with many former prisoners of war and families of missing in action in the audience, Mr. Reagan said the prisoners of war ''have been, and are, the bravest of the brave.''  ''They kept a trusting heart, they retained their spirit and their will, and they kept the faith,'' he said. ''They trusted us, and that trust did us great honor.''  He pledged that the Administration would make a major effort on behalf of the missing in action, or those who are assumed to be killed, but whose remains have not been recovered. Mr. Reagan, implicitly seeming to criticize past Administrations, said the families of the missing had for many years ''stood alone in your quest for answers.''  ''Well, today, you're not alone,'' he said. ''And I tell you from my heart, you will never be alone again.''  'Sightings' by Refugees  Of the 2,489 Americans listed as unaccounted for, about 1,150 have been reported killed in action, but their remains have not been recovered. Of the others, American officials have said there is no verified evidence that any are alive, although there have been ''sightings.'' Most such sightings have been by Vietnamese refugees, who say they have seen people they assumed to be Americans.  On Wednesday Secretary of State George P. Shultz said that Vietnam had agreed to resume talks in mid-August on locating the remains and providing information on those unaccounted for in Vietnam.  Mr. Reagan, noting that today was the 30th anniversary of the signing of agreements in Geneva on Indochina, said the hoped-for peace had never come to that part of the world. He said Vietnam and the United States ''still have major differences.''  But he said he was ''encouraged'' by Vietnam's willingness to cooperate on the missing-in-action question.  8,177 Missing in Korea  Mr. Reagan said resolution of that issue, as well as Vietnam's agreement to negotiations on Cambodia with other countries in the area, ''provide the key for ending Vietnam's isolation.''  ''Normal relations with the international community can bring an end to the long suffering of the people of Vietnam,'' he said. ''And I believe it to be in Vietnam's own interest to choose this path. It's a decision that we would welcome.''  Mr. Reagan also addressed the less publicized situation in Korea, where 8,177 Americans are officially listed as unaccounted for. He said the United States had pressed North Korea for an accounting of any missing from that war. He also said some Korean War veterans recently provided information on possible grave locations.  A White House official said the information was on possible sites in South Korea, and talks were going on with the South Korean Government. But neither State Department nor Pentagon officials were able to shed light on why it had taken so long to find sites in South Korea, a United States ally.

"   , L.I.   A terrible wrong was committed 11 years ago: 566 servicemen lost in Laos were abandoned without a trace. While almost 600 war prisoners held in North Vietnam came home in early 1973, not one of the 566 has ever come home - dead or alive. This tragedy continues.  Gen. Eugene Tighe, who at the time was director of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, recently testified that he believed that our men were still held in Laos. Privately, D.I.A. analysts concede that P.O.W.'s are still alive there, differing only on how many there are. The most recent estimates range from 20 to 253.  Hundreds of recent refugee reports, verified with ''lie-detector'' machines, describe similar scenes: American pilots are held virtually as slaves in caves and remote villages, guarded by Vietnamese and Laotian soldiers, at times forced to repair American weapons and electronic equipment left over from the war.  How did this happen? On Jan. 27, 1973, America and North Vietnam signed the Paris Peace Accords, which provided for the return of all P.O.W.'s in Vietnam. Neighboring Laos was not a participant and no provision was made for return of P.O.W.'s there.  On Feb. 1, 1973, President Richard M. Nixon sent to Prime Minister Pham Van Dong a letter pledging $3.25 billion in reconstruction funds if Hanoi honored the treaty - and if Congress appropriated the money. In exchange, Hanoi was to provide a complete list of all P.O.W.'s in Laos. It did not. To this day, it has provided no information on any of the 566.  Then, on Feb. 5, 1973, an American bomber was shot down in Laos with seven men on board. National Se  curity Agency radio intercepts confirm that four were taken prisoner. Nothing has been done about them.  Meanwhile, Capitol Hill made it clear that it would not appropriate the $3.25 billion. But Hanoi had shrewdly created an insurance policy against the possibility that the money would fall through: the P.O.W.'s in Laos were a bargaining chip.  By early March, it was obvious the funds would not be voted. Henry A. Kissinger, architect of the Paris treaty and then national security adviser, dispatched Robert C. McFarlane, now President Reagan's national security adviser, to Paris to make a new offer: America would exchange $100 million in medicine for the P.O.W.'s in Laos. Hanoi did not deny the P.O.W.'s were there; instead, it countered: We don't want just $100 million; we want the $3.25 billion Nixon promised us. With Congress unwilling to appropriate this sum, and Hanoi unwilling to settle for less, the Administration was stuck.  Just when the public should have been informed of the dilemma, Watergate convulsed the nation. Vietnam and Laos took a back seat.  For 11 years, Hanoi has positioned itself to ''find'' the P.O.W.'s. In a private message to me in September 1981, its ambassador to Thailand said: ''Cases of Americans reportedly captured but not registered with the center responsible for P.O.W.'s require time for investigation and searching. Failure to register these cases was due to many war circumstances which led to their missing on the way from the places of capture to the detention centers.'' In a face-saving manner, the North Vietnamese continue to give themselves an ''out.''  Why does the situation remain unresolved? Because Hanoi's policy is not to ''find'' the P.O.W.'s until Washington stops supporting Peking, opens full diplomatic relations with Hanoi and makes good on past promises. And because of the Reagan Administration's refusal to improve relations until Hanoi makes a complete accounting of all the P.O.W.'s. The P.O.W.'s must wonder: ''Why has America abandoned us?''  How to break this stalemate?  One Communist official told me in 1981: ''How can we ask our peasants to look for your (troops) when you have destroyed all our schools and hospitals? If America gives our people hospitals and schools, then we can ask these peasants to look for your (troops).''  The only way to bring home the P.O.W.'s is to swallow some pride in admitting that we lost the war and that Hanoi holds all the cards. We must provide, without a quid pro quo, a multibillion dollar reconstruction program involving medicine, hospitals, X-ray equipment, schools and other nonmilitary humanitarian aid.  We don't put a price on human life; the North Vietnamese do. B  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: OP-ED                      ",August 20 1984 ,0
"      Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam said Tuesday that his country would welcome attempts by a third party to promote peace in Cambodia, the Kyodo news agency reported today.  Mr. Thach also said Hanoi would continue searching for American soldiers missing since the Vietnam War and repeated his nation's willingness to allow political dissidents to leave the country, Kyodo reported in a dispatch from Hanoi.  The agency said Mr. Thach told its correspondent that Vietnam would unconditionally negotiate a peace proposal by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has demanded that free elections be held in Cambodia and that Vietnam withdraw its troops from the country.  ''It would be better to form an international supervisory commission by neutral nations and let it play the role of peacekeeping in Cambodia,'' Mr. Thach was quoted as having said.  His statement appeared to reverse Vietnam's previous policy rejecting the United Nations as a mediator and an Indonesian proposal for the creation of an international supervisory group.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 15   He is a slight man of 37 now, confined to a refugee center and looking for a new home.  In 1975, when the North Vietnamese took Saigon, he was a captain in the South Vietnamese Army and, like tens of thousands of his compatriots, he was sent for ''re-education'' to a prison camp. There, he spent the next six years of his life. One day, without explanation, he was freed.  On Wednesday, he talked with visitors to the Panat Nikhom refugee transit center in eastern Thailand, where the police brought him after he had washed up, a boat person, on a Thai beach.  The man was interviewed the day after Secretary of State George P. Shultz announced in Washington that the United States was ready to admit 10,000 former and current Vietnamese political prisoners from the re-education camps, as well as the thousands of Vietnamese children fathered by Americans.  From the stories of exiles like the former army captain, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of causing harm to his family still in Vietnam, refugee officials have been able to draw a composite picture of life in Vietnamese political prisons. The former captain said it was characterized chiefly by hard agricultural labor, little nourishing food and no visits from relatives for months at a time. He said, however, that he knew of few instances of beatings or torture, and that he had been forced into what he regarded as a minimal amount of political indoctrination.  But other former camp inmates, officials in Thailand say, tell of harsher treatment, particularly for those who were outspoken political dissenters, indicating regional police authorities were taking different approaches. Some former prisoners reaching the West have told of being confined to boxes or cages for long periods of time. Occasional executions have also been reported.  Hanoi has not responded officially to the American offer to accept the political prisoners and the children, which Mr. Shultz announced in testimony before Congress. Diplomats here said they expected that a response might come in Geneva at the beginning of next month, when Vietnam will meet with officials of resettlement countries, including the United States, during the annual executive session of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Most of the re-education camp inmates were imprisoned because of their participation in the former South Vietnamese Government and its armed forces or for their ties with Americans in Vietnam.  Refugee officals say no one knows exactly how many political prisoners Vietnam still holds. Hanoi's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, has suggested there are 10,000.  In addition, there are tens of thousands of former inmates of the camps - which may have held a total over the last decade of as many as 150,000 men and women - who might try to obtain exit visas from Vietnam because they had been imprisoned. Until now, refugee officials say, the Vietnamese Government has not granted exit permits to its citizens solely because they had been camp inmates. United States officials say they know of at least 18,000 former prison inmates among their own records of applicants for asylum.  Problem of Malnutrition   The United States has pledged to take family members as well as camp inmates. In many instances families number more than a dozen people.  Refugee officials who have examined former camp inmates at transit centers in Southeast Asia report that they are often suffering from health problems associated with malnutrition and an unbalanced diet: bad teeth, eye defects, scurvy, ulcers. For some, meals never consisted of more than rice and salt, with occasional pieces of fish. The exiled captain said he was often able to prepare some extra food for himself in the evenings.  Vietnam opened its first re-education centers within days of the fall of Saigon, former prisoners say. Many relativly unimportant or low-ranking South Vietnamese with connections to the fallen government were confined for relatively short periods in April and May 1975.  By June, officials say, higher-ranking officers were beginning to be jailed. At this point the word ''studies,'' which became ''re-education'' in common parlance, was dropped from the description of the camps and the Vietnamese word for ''reconstruction'' - the same term North Vietnam had earlier employed to describe its prisons - was substituted. As many as 100 of the camps, many of them in the Saigon region, were apparently in operation during this period.  Lower Officers Released  By 1978, according to former prisoners' accounts, which officials caution are always fragmentary because they had no access to records, lower officers began to be released. Military men from the rank of colonel upward were moved farther north.  In 1980 there appears to have been a new series of arrests. Some officials speculate that this may have been because a number of infuential Vietnamese refugees in the United States had begun to speak openly of resistance. But after six months, as applications for emigration and certificates of release examined by refugee officers indicate, many prisoners were again being released. The releases have more or less continued to the present time, and Hanoi may be looking for a way to close most of the centers. Refugee officials say they think there may be 8, possibly 10 camps left.  Refugees reaching Thailand and other Asian countries from Vietnam have reported that those who are rleased from camps often buy their way out by bribing authorities with gold: 12 to 20 ounces seems to be the prevailing rate. After release, former prisoners are put on probation, usually for a year, and often assigned to work in one of Vietnam's New Economic Zones.  Most former prisoners then attempt to use family connections to get themselves back on a civil registry or census so that they can obtain identity cards without which they cannot apply for exit permits. Vietnam has been granting these since 1979 under a United Nations Orderly Departure Program. Nearly 70,000 Vietnamese have left under this program. Hundreds of thousands have fled illegally.  Offer Made Three Years Ago  Refugee officials say there is little concern that Vietnam will use the opportunity of the American offer - which diplomats point out was first made three years ago by Under Secretary of State Walter Stoessel after Hanoi first suggested that the United States take the inmates - as President Castro of Cuba seized the opportunity of the Mariel boatlift to empty Cuban prisons and mental institutions.  Some officials in international organizations who have worked with the Vietnamese over the years of the Orderly Departure Program, under which the camp inmates would be processed, say that Hanoi has never been prone to whimsical decisions in refugee affairs.  Others suggest that Hanoi, facing severe economic problems, has been looking for ways to improve its relations with both the United States and the neighboring countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ties that have been frozen over the issue of Hanoi's military presence in Cambodia and Laos.

"    Help for Those   Left Behind  Although the Vietnam War ended a decade ago, many Vietnamese are still paying for their political and personal association with the United States. Thousands of children who were fathered by Americans endure discrimination and thousands of Vietnamese with close ties to the United States during the war were imprisoned in ''re-education'' camps, where many remain.  Last week, the United States officially accepted responsibility for these people. Secretary of State George P. Shultz told a Senate subcommittee that Washington was ready to call on Hanoi to make good its promise to allow the Amerasians, political prisoners and ''qualifying family members'' to come to this country.  Hanoi says there are 15,000 Amerasian children; the State Department puts the number closer to 8,000. Vietnam says there are 10,000 political prisoners; Washington says 6,000 to 15,000. The prisoners, many of whom were officials in the South Vietnamese Government, ''are of particular humanitarian concern to the United States,'' Mr. Shultz said.  Despite two years of efforts to arrange for the release of the political prisoners, only about 100 have been allowed to emigrate, according to the Reagan Administration. About 3,000 Amerasian children and their families have already been admitted to the United States.  The plan outlined by Mr. Shultz is part of the Administration's effort to set a ceiling of 70,000 refugees to be admitted from around the world for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Of that number, 50,000 could be from East Asia.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 16 1984 ,0
"   , Thailand, Jan. 4   Two of five men condemned to death in a highly publicized subversion trial in Vietnam have had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment, Vietnam's official press agency reported.  The death sentences were handed down Dec. 18 at the end of the trial in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. A total of 21 men were tried on charges of seeking to overthrow the Vietnamese Government with Chinese backing. Apart from the 5 men sentenced to death, 3 were sentenced to life imprisonment and the rest got terms ranging from 8 to 20 years. The trial was reported to be the biggest espionage and treason trial since the capture of South Vietnam in 1975.  Statements made in court indicate that the five convicted men, said to be linked to a Vietnamese exile group based in France, may have managed to draw a few local Vietnamese officials into their plot. One such official was reported to have committed suicide when his complicity became known.  2 Claim French Citizenship   The two men whose death sentences were commuted Thursday, Mai Van Hanh, 56 years old, and Huynh Vinh Sanh, 63, both claim French nationality. France regards Mr. Hanh, a former pilot accused of being the ringleader of the plot, as a French citizen; Paris has not ruled on Mr. Sanh's claim. French diplomats in Vietnam were not permitted to visit the men.  Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and the French Ambassador in Hanoi had appealed for clemency for all five of the condemned. No mention was made in the statement Thursday of the other three men, Tran Van Ba, 39; Le Quoc Quan, 43, and Ho Thi Bach, 48.  Several men accused of leading the plot, including Mr. Hanh, were reported to have arrived in Vietnam in September. They were seized and brought to trial with other prisoners who had been held for several years on subversion charges.  Nearly 100 other people were reported to be awaiting trial on similar offenses.  In Hanoi, Vietnamese officials have said that evidence emerging from this trial played a part in the decision to pull back from their plan to release to the United States the inmates of the ''re-education'' camps. They say they fear the exiles would join subversive groups abroad working against Hanoi.  Vietnam has also said that at least one of the plotters who received a death sentence, Mr. Ba, a former student leader, had made contact with American diplomats in Bangkok. The United States has denied the accusation.  According to Hanoi's investigations, the plot had reached surprisingly serious proportions. Vietnam has said the plotters intended to begin a campaign of terrorism in several cities early this year, while at the same time ''encircling the towns'' through subversion in the countryside.  Seen as a Warning   Diplomats in Hanoi, interviewed just after the trial, said they doubted there was a significant subversive movement in Vietnam. But they said there continued to be dissatisfaction in the south centered around Ho Chi Minh City, and that Hanoi appeared to be serving notice on would-be rebels.  Some Vietnamese exiles who have fled the southern part of the country and are now in holding centers along the Thai-Cambodian border say there is an armed underground, but they have no reliable evidence of its size.  The accused, court documents said, had intended to open prison camps and arm the inmates, many of them former South Vietnamese officers.  Several religious figures, including a leader of the Cao Dai sect, were singled out at the trial and in the collected evidence as participants or sympathizers. This has been interpreted as a warning to religious groups not to take part in dissident activities.    Vietnam Announces Cease-Fire   BANGKOK, Jan. 4 (Reuters) - Vietnam will observe a 41-day cease-fire along its border with China to mark 35 years of diplomatic relations between them and to celebrate the Lunar New Year, the Vietnam News Agency said today.

"    GROVE, Calif.   The police in this southern California town recently encountered a teen-age Vietnamese who had been shot outside a fast-food restaurant at 2 A.M.  When questioned, the youth insisted he had simply been getting off a bus when he was caught in a gunfight between rival groups of blacks and whites. ''But the buses don't run that late,'' said Lieut. Kenneth Adair of the Garden Grove police. ''There were serious questions about his story.''  The unresolved shooting is cited by the police as part of a growing incidence of crime among some of the 450,000 Vietnamese refugees in the United States that has frustrated and divided law-enforcement officials around the country.  Wartime Prejudice Is Seen  The police, baffled by the language barrier and the historical Vietnamese distrust of authority, which often make it difficult for them to deal with the refugees, find themselves in broad disagreement on whether there is any organization behind such Vietnamese crime.  Some officials believe there is at least a minimal link between gangs in different cities; others contend that there may be a nationwide Vietnamese criminal syndicate headed by former South Vietnamese generals.  Some specialists dismiss both theories as demeaning speculation based on American prejudices from the Vietnam War era. They believe that what crime there is among the exiles is now committed by a small number of the young, in poorly organized street gangs, similar to other urban youth gangs. Vietnamese actually commit less crime than other ethnic groups in the United States, said one expert, William L. Cassidy, a private investigator.  The police do agree, however, that in the past few years there has been a shift in the pattern of crime among Vietnamese, with a decrease in extortion against businesses by former soldiers and a rise in armed robbery and murder by younger Vietnamese.  Rise in Household Robberies  In the past year, for example, there has been a surge in household robberies by heavily armed Vietnamese gangs in Orange County, the suburban area south of Los Angeles in which Garden Grove is situated. The county now has about 90,000 Vietnamese residents, by far the largest concentration in the country.  More than 30 such armed robberies were reported, according to the authorities. In a number of the robberies the victims had been tied up or shot, and the gangs had later telephoned to demand further payments. Lieutenant Adair estimated that crime by Vietnamese now accounted for 25 percent of the work of the investigation division of the Garden Grove police. ''And it's going up fast,'' he said.  Some law-enforcement officials, like Capt. Donald Saviers of the Police Department in Westminster, which adjoins Garden Grove, believe there must be some form of structure behind this increase.  ''They're so cockeyed mobile,'' he said. ''They can rob a shopping center in Orange County one day, then jump in their cars and a few days later hit some place in San Jose, Houston, or Washington, where there are other large groups of Vietnamese. It indicates a level of organization which we just haven't penetrated.''  Other law-enforcement authorities, as well as testimony before the President's Commission on Organized Crime, have gone further, suggesting the organization is nationwide in scope and is headed by Nguyen Cao Ky, the former South Vietnamese Prime Minister. Mr. Ky has denied it.  'There Is No Vietnamese Mafia'  Oliver B. Revell, the assistant director of the criminal investigative division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is among those who dispute that theory. ''The Vietnamese have not reached the point of having any kind of nationwide organized crime,'' he said.  Mr. Cassidy put it even more strongly in a speech in November to the seventh annual conference on Asian Organized Crime in Washington. ''There is no Vietnamese Mafia, no Vietnamese godfather, no convenient single explanation for Vietnamese criminal activity,'' he said. Mr. Cassidy works in Orange County, speaks Vietnamese and has worked as a consultant on Vietnamese crime for police departments around the country, the Department of the Treasury and the Senate.  In the view of Mr. Cassidy, ''What we are really fighting is not a war of cops versus robbers but a war of cultural assumptions, just like we did in Vietnam.''  ''You must remember that when the first Vietnamese refugees came to the U.S. in 1975 and police began to hear reports about crime among them, we were conditioned to believe the worst about Vietnamese,'' he added. ''There were all those lurid stories about corruption in Saigon, South Vietnamese generals selling drugs and refugees escaping with suitcases loaded with gold.''  1979 Report Is Cited  This thinking, Mr. Cassidy asserted, culminated in a confidential report in 1979 by Louis Spalla, an officer of the Arizona Narcotics Strike Force, who had served in Vietnam as an adviser to the South Vietnamese police. The report, which Mr. Spalla said was based on a three-day trip to Los Angeles and San Diego, said there was a nationwide Vietnamese ''Mafia-type organization'' known as the Association.  As Mr. Spalla described it, the group was headed by Mr. Ky, who he said had escaped from Saigon with $600 million in gold and diamonds. He said it also had networks of former South Vietnamese soldiers who served as enforcers with exotic names like the Frogmen and was engaged in crimes from drug smuggling and extortion to prostitution and murder.  Mr. Spalla's report was widely circulated to police departments around the country, was later used by some newspapers and television programs about Mr. Ky.   Report Called 'Discredited'  Mr. Cassidy, in a confidential report last year on Vietnamese crime for the Intelligence Studies Foundation in Oakland, Calif., termed Mr. Spalla's work ''now totally discredited.''  Mr. Spalla was asked in a telephone interview if he still believed that his report was accurate. ''I cannot assess the report now,'' he said, because ''I haven't worked on that in a lot of years.''  But at its hearings on Asian organized crime in October, the President's Commission on Organized Crime heard a hooded, unidentified witness who described a similar Vietnamese criminal syndicate with 1,000 members in 15 states. He testified he had been told the organization was headed by Mr. Ky, with four to five former South Vietnamese generals under him.  James D. Harmon, the commission's chief counsel, said later that the witness was an ethnic Chinese from Vietnam, not a Vietnamese. Mr. Harmon said he had no comment on the similarity between the Spalla report and the testimony of the witness.  Ky Has Declared Bankruptcy  The local police in southern California, where Mr. Ky now lives and works, running a liquor store, say they have no evidence the former South Vietnamese leader is involved in criminal activity.  ''If he's a godfather, he's the poorest godfather in America,'' remarked Jon D. Elder, Chief of Police in Monterey Park, a Los Angeles suburb. In fact, Mr. Ky, who is 55 years old, declared bankruptcy last year and has put his house, valued at $250,000, up for sale.  ''I've denied having any involvement in crime again and again,'' Mr. Ky said in an interview, his face rounder and his hair thinner than when he was Prime Minister.  Rise in Youth Crime  Some officials who came to believe that Mr. Ky and other South Vietnamese generals might be behind the crime cited as one reason the extortion committed by former South Vietnamese soldiers who arrived in this country after Saigon was captured in 1975 and who had difficulty adapting to life in this country.  In Garden Grove, up to 70 percent of Vietnamese businesses paid protection money, Lieutenant Adair said, ''but now they've begun to trust the police more and realize they don't have to pay that 'Vietnamese tax.' ''  Instead, in the past three years, Lieutenant Adair explained, crimes like armed robbery, car theft and murder committed by younger Vietnamese have become more common.  The new criminals, typically 15 to 23 years old, were too young to have been in the war. In Garden Grove these criminals have banded together in loose groups of 4 to 50 members, although the police have not been able to deduce what structure, if any, they have, Lieutenant Adair said.  Mr. Cassidy says the tendency of these Vietnamese to move from city to city is largely a reflection of their lack of family roots rather than evidence of a criminal organization.  He says most of these youthful gang members came not with the first wave of Vietnamese exiles but with the people who left by boat after 1977.  ''The boat people were poorer, didn't speak as much English, had trouble finding good jobs in the States and often arrived without other family members,'' Mr. Cassidy said. ''It was the classic background for juvenile gangs.''  Money Laundering Is Reported  Another problem is the large-scale illicit transfer of dollars to Vietnam by the refugees through ''underground collection centers disguised as commercial enterprises,'' Mr. Cassidy said. In hearings in June before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Mr. Cassidy asserted that the exiles were sending $200 million a year, half of it through these illegal enterprises, to relatives in Vietnam. The money cannot be sent directly through legitimate channels because Washington maintains an embargo on trade with Vietnam.  He said the ''collection centers'' usually charged a commission of 15 to 25 percent and that he feared they may be fronts for other criminal activities, using some of the money to buy guns or to operate drug rings.  The authorities are also divided on whether any of the anti-Communist groups that have sprung up recently among the Vietnamese refugees are involved in crime.  Resistance Group Rebuts Charge  Tran Minh Cong, a spokesman for the National United Front for the Liberation of Vietnam, the biggest such group, said his group did not participate in extortion or other crimes, as some reports have asserted. ''There's no proof, but people keep talking about a Vietnamese Mafia and it hurts the image of the refugees,'' he said. ''It fits into Hanoi's claim that anyone who flees Vietnam is just a criminal.''  Mr. Cong's view was buttressed by several Vietnamese journalists, teachers and doctors in Orange County who are not associated with the front.  Still, some Vietnamese sympathetic to Hanoi say that anti-Communist groups use the threat of violence to silence them.  Nguyen Van Luy, a 72-year-old restaurant owner in San Francisco who was an antiwar activist in the 1960's, was shot and his wife killed last spring by a man who spoke Vietnamese. A group calling itself the Vietnamese Organization to Exterminate Communists and Restore the Nation took responsibility, as it did for the 1981 killing of a pro-Hanoi journalist in San Francisco. Mr. Luy says he was shot by ''right-wing reactionaries.'' But the San Francisco police say they can find no evidence the group exists and that there are possible personal motives.  Mr. Cassidy is concerned that the effort by some law-enforcement agencies to find a ''Vietnamese Mafia'' is ''missing the embryonic organized crime that may be there.''  Mr. Cassidy, who noted that some Vietnamese who fish for shrimp on the Gulf Coast are now suspected of using their boats to smuggle cocaine for American organized crime, says he fears the Vietnamese may eventually learn too much from Americans. ''If a Vietnamese Mafia comes into existence, it will be because we helped create it,'' he said.   Next: The Japanese.

"   , Vietnam, Jan. 27   ''Vietnam has lived without you for a thousand years, and we can live without you for a thousand more,'' a Foreign Ministry official told a group of visiting Americans recently.  But diplomats and development experts from both Western and Eastern bloc nations, interviewed here on the eve of the arrival Monday of Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, tell a different story. Vietnam, they say, is desperately in need of Western assistance and wants to improve its relations with the United States.  The major stumbling block is Hanoi's occupation of Cambodia, which has led to the curtailment of most Western aid and stood in the way of the establishment of diplomatic ties with Washington. The visit of Mr. Perez de Cuellar, his first to Hanoi as Secretary General, is therefore being watched closely by diplomats for signs of new initiatives on Cambodia from Hanoi.  In assessing the impasse, the Vietnamese leadership appears to be torn between staying in Cambodia for reasons of national security and finding a way to leave in the hope of attracting more development aid.  Major Health Problems  Vietnam, the diplomats and aid officials say, is a country where malnutrition and intestinal infections that have disappeared from many parts of Asia are still the major health problems. It is a country where the standards of many goods and services are falling rather than rising, where one of the most sought-after skills is the repair and rehabilitation of obsolete machinery.  ''Every time I pass through Bangkok on my way here,'' an American scholar said, ''I see the gap between Thailand and Vietnam getting wider.''  According to its own official figures, Vietnam failed to meet most of its major economic targets last year. Nearly a decade after the fall of Saigon, Vietnam (with a per-capita income lower than India's) ranks with its allies Laos and Cambodia as the poorest nation in Southeast Asia.  The evidence can be seen in the streets of Hanoi, a beautiful city almost unchanged architecturally since it was abandoned by the French 30 years ago. Shabbily dressed people crowd into rundown homes and ride ancient trams brought here decades ago from Strasbourg. Drinking water is no longer chlorinated, the electricity supply is erratic. A worker's basic wage hovers around one dollar a month at the black market exchange rate, about $25 at the inflated official rate. A bicycle, most people's only form of transportation, can cost as much as $100.  Guerrilla Camps Emptied  Vietnam's critics say Hanoi may have already decided not to give ground on the Cambodia issue, particularly now that its troops have successfully emptied the guerrilla camps of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, the larger of two non-Communist opposition groups loosely allied with the Communist Khmer Rouge against the Vietnamese-backed Government in Phnom Penh.  Hanoi, diplomats say, may be hoping instead to persuade the United Nations, which has called for Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia and does not recognize the Phnom Penh regime, to accept the status quo.  If this is true, diplomats say, the reasons are manifold and complex, more often conjecture than known, because Hanoi remains one of the toughest, most distrustful and most secretive of capitals in which to work.  This atmosphere, according to foreign residents, grows out of an overriding obsession with national security, born of 40 years of war and possibly encouraged by the presence of large numbers of Soviet advisers.  ''It is impossible to exaggerate the paranoia of Vietnam,'' a diplomat said.  Internal Discord Suggested  These fears of vulnerability, coupled with a historical tendency to see Greater Indochina as its sphere of influence, make Hanoi reluctant to abandon the Cambodian buffer, diplomats say. Some diplomats sympathetic to Vietnam say Hanoi may have rightly calculated that the loss of control over Cambodia may be too high a price to pay for what might turn out to be a disappointing amount of Western aid.  Internal disagreements may also be playing a part in the reluctance to compromise on Cambodia, diplomats suggest. Hanoi's apparent change of heart on the release of ''re-education'' camp inmates - now called ''criminals'' here - may reflect pressure on foreign- policy makers from national and provincial security officials, some diplomats say.  Fears of foreign-supported subversion has kept high the level of accusatory polemics directed at China, Thailand and the United States. What is not certain, according to diplomats, is whether this hard line is unanimous. They say there seem to be those in the leadership who want better Chinese ties and who might prefer working with Peking than Moscow despite centuries of China-Vietnam rivalry.  Preoccupation with security has led, aid experts say, to an inattention to development needs. There has been little long-range planning and little construction of necessary energy plants, roads and buildings. Without this, economic experts say, gaps between Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (and China under its new economic policies) will grow geometrically.  Heavy Spending on Army  Vietnam, already heavily in debt to the Soviet bloc, is now thought to spend more than half its gross national product on the military and maintains the world's fourth-largest armed forces.  There are known to be younger men in the ranks of future political leaders who want to outgrow the ''perpetual struggle'' mentality of the past and concentrate more on economic development, taking a more pragmatic approach and drawing on Western technological and management skills. Efforts to loosen controls on both agriculture and small industry have already paid off in some areas, but the experiment remains controversial.  Disagreements over budget and planning policies may be holding up the calling of the next party congress, some diplomats suggest.  Soviet aid, thought to be worth more than a billion dollars a year, has had little effect on daily life, residents of Hanoi say. East bloc equipment is sometimes technically inferior and inappropriate for Vietnam's needs, aid experts add.  ''I have seen a new machine come off the boat from Eastern Europe that was 30 years out of date the day it was made,'' an aid official said, ''These people deserve better.''

He accepts payment without expression and returns wearily to his step.  With severe shortages of most consumer goods and minimal public services, Hanoi's residents continue to draw on their resourcefulness. The old man with his scale is but one of hundreds, if not thousands, of small entrepreneurial efforts on city sidewalks.    A Gradual Improvement  Frequent visitors to Hanoi say that over the last five or six years, the quality of life has improved in this capital city, a fine example of French colonial architecture that was damaged surprisingly little by American bombing in 1972. There are more goods in the stores, more television sets in homes and brighter colors on people and buildings.  But Hanoi and the overpopulated, impoverished north, its soil depleted and its forests fast disappearing, are still a world away from southern Vietnam.    Making Do in the North  In the south, consumer goods apparently are abundant. The Deputy Mayor of Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, boasts that food rations have tripled in a decade and that most businesses with fewer than 20 employees are in private hands. So is two-thirds of the city's housing, he adds.  ''One country, two systems,'' people here say sardonically, echoing the formula the Chinese have used to describe how Peking hopes to coexist with Hong Kong when it reverts to Chinese rule.  Hanoi's residents have come to assume that most things unavailable here must be found in the south. Requests for a commodity or service - a certain book, a restaurant, a map, a telex, an international telephone line or a taxi - are met with the stock, almost reflexive, reply: ''We don't have it in Hanoi, but in Saigon. . . . '' So in Hanoi, people make do. Entrepreneurs fix bicycles, refill the refills of ballpoint pens or sell things: dumplings, bowls of soup, vegetables from their gardens, individual envelopes or cigarettes, handmade objects of bamboo and straw. Moneychangers, paying more than 20 times the official exchange rate for foreign currency, thrive.  Recyling is an art: The pull-tab from an imported aluminum can is bought for a fraction of a cent and used to make curtain rings. The can itself fetches anywhere from a dime to more than a dollar and has many uses. Old movie film is fashioned into celluloid picture frames.  At night a visitor passes an old woman selling used bottles of all sizes in the front room of her home. A few people beg, and others sleep huddled in doorways.  Although such scenes of everyday life might not suggest it, this is a year of celebrations for Vietnam. In October Hanoi celebrated 30 years of liberation from the French. In April Ho Chi Minh City, which its own tourist bureau still calls Saigon, will mark the 10th anniversary of the Communist victory over South Vietnam's American-supported Government.  In between, the army marked its 40th birthday in December, a reminder that after 40 years Vietnam is still at war - now in Cambodia and on the border with China - and another generation is being called on to make sacrifices.  The Peach Blossoms of Tet  This is not to say that all is sacrifice and no amusement in Hanoi. The city's young people seek their pleasures in movies, in window-shopping at Government stores or in walks by the city's lakes or in its parks, now sprinkled with the pink peach blossoms that are the flower of Tet, the Vietnamese New Year, in the north. The young also read.  At the Hanoi-Hue-Saigon bookstore, the city's largest, a clerk in the section marked Literature reported that her biggest sellers were romantic novels and detective stories.  She said a favorite among the books, which were priced inexpensively from a few cents to about half a dollar at street exchange rates, was ''Romeo, Juliet and Darkness,'' a love story by an author named Jan Otsenasech set against the evil of Nazi Germany. ''A lot of books come from the Russians,'' an English- speaking browser volunteered.  The store, which had one copy of a Vietnamese translation of Graham Greene's ''The Quiet American,'' also sold collections of contemporary Vietnamese short stories, published locally in pamphlet form on coarse brown paper.  Themes of endless war and remembered heroics mixed with grief mark these stories, which are often short morality lessons. They jolt the foreign reader into an awareness of how ''the American war'' has already slipped back into history, taking its place behind the newest threat from the Chinese. It is overshadowed by universal preoccupations, like the concern of one character that his spoiled, long-haired son will come to no good.  In the collection called ''The Years After,'' the American war becomes a stage set. A story by Nguyen Minh Chau about a militant woman who has to learn love and compassion opens with the line: ''The battalion was installed on an old American base.''  ''The Vietnamese are ambivalent about Americans,'' a Western diplomat said. ''Despite the war, they respond more to American culture than to Russian, and want more contacts with American people.''  Scarce Housing  Housing, which is controlled by the Government, is scarce in Hanoi. Requests by at least one international agency for permission to build apartments at its own expense have met countless bureaucratic obstacles.  The West German Ambassador and his family live in a few rooms of the Thong Nhat Hotel, the rundown ghost of the once-grand Metropole. A Canadian forester on duty with the United Nations has been living there for two years with his wife and three sons. They can be seen trooping into the dining room at lunch and dinner bearing their own mustard and peanut butter to augment the spartan fare.  All diplomatic eyes are on a mysterious green villa, which, by common understanding, seems to be reserved for the American Embassy if and when diplomatic links are forged and the Yankees return.  ''We know it must be for the Americans,'' one diplomat said, ''because the Soviet Embassy is also painted green and we figure that's the superpower color.''

"   , Thailand, Feb. 3   Vietnam's Communist Party leader has acknowledged in a speech marking the party's 55th anniversary that there are ''shortcomings and mistakes'' in Vietnam's economic and ideological affairs, according to reports from the Vietnam News Agency.  The official Hanoi agency, monitored in Bangkok, said the party chief, Le Duan, also told party and Government officials Saturday that the country should improve its relations with China and with the non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia, while continuing to build ties to Moscow.  The speech came at a time when diplomats in Hanoi suggest that a faction of Vietnam's leadership has become wary of the growing dependence on the Soviet Union and would like to keep a line open to Peking.  Relations between the Chinese and Vietnamese - traditional enemies until this century's wars against the French and Americans - have deteriorated again over the last six years, as Peking has given substantial material support to rebels in Cambodia who are trying to overthrow the Vietnamese-installed Government in Phnom Penh.  Reported to Seek Talks  Last week in Bangkok, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the Cambodian rebel coalition, said he had been told in Peking that Vietnam had been seeking talks with China. Along with their disagreement over Cambodia, the Vietnamese and Chinese have been fighting sporadically along their common border.  ''We are prepared to normalize relations with China,'' the Vietnamese party's Secretary General was reported to have said, adding that Hanoi ''firmly believes that the friendship between the two countries will have to be restored.''  Mr. Duan's speech follows a report by Hanoi in December that acknowledged a failure to meet nearly all the country's economic targets for 1984. Vietnam and its allies, Laos and Cambodia, are among Asia's poorest nations.  Diplomats in Hanoi say there appear to be continuing disagreements in the Hanoi leadership on recent experiments in liberalized economic policies, not unlike China's moves toward a pragmatic, less ideological approach.  In the speech, Mr. Duan seemed to be, as he has been before, on the side of liberalized changes. He was reported to have said ''dynamic and flexible management'' was the way to ''high productivity.''   LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",February 4 1985 ,1

"   , Thailand, Feb. 22   American military officers indicated today that it would take at least a month to begin identifying remains found at a site in Laos where an American gunship crashed during the Vietnam War.  At the same time, they praised Laos for its ''extreme cooperation'' in assisting in the search.  The Laotian-American excavation took place last week at a site near Pakse, in eastern Laos, where an American C-130 went down in December 1972 with 16 servicemen aboard. Two survived the crash, one body was found, and 13 men have been reported missing in action.  ''There was a midair explosion at 7,500 feet,'' Lieut. Col. Joe Harvey, said of the plane, which was struck by antiaricraft fire. ''One wing came off. It went into a steep dive. When it crashed, a large amount of ordnance exploded. The plane burned for two days. Identities will be very difficult to establish.''  ''We recovered everthing that could be recovered,'' Maj. Johnie E. Webb, head of the Central Identification Center in Honolulu, said at a news conference today.  Both he and Colonel Harvey indicated that it would take at least a month to begin the identifications. The remains and personal possessions are being taken to Honolulu for examination.  Major Webb described the crash site as ''covered with undergrowth five to six feet tall.''  Praising the ''extreme cooperation'' of the Laotian military authorities who searched with the Americans, he said:  ''We cut all the underbrush and removed it. We then formed a skirmish line - all of us on our hands and knees, shoulder to shoulder - to search the ground.''  ''We got everything,'' he said. ''I see no reason to go back.''  The leaders of the operation, the first joint American-Indochinese search for Americans lost during the war, returned to Bangkok today. At the news conference, Colonel Harvey, commander of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Honolulu, said he hoped the cooperative effort with Laos ''will lead to an overall improvement in relations.''  Laos, where there is a small American diplomatic mission led by a charge d'affaires, is the first of the three Indochinese Communist nations to allow a joint excavation. Vietnam and Cambodia, with which the United States does not have formal diplomatic relations, have refused to sanction similar explorations.  The United States has listed 2,483 Americans still missing since the Vietnam War, most of them in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. A few are thought to have died or disappeared in Thailand and China, and others were lost over water.  The Reagan Administration has said progress on the search for bodies or information on the whereabouts of the missing Americans is a prerequisite for better relations with Indochinese Communist nations.

"    is Vietnam like today? A five   -part report on NBC's ''Today'' suggests that high spirits, good works and incipient capitalism flourish. Does this mean the reports tilt toward America's old adversaries? Well, yes and no, and if this is equivocal, so are the reports. Don't dismiss them for that, however; they are fascinating pieces of work.  ''Today,'' beginning at 7 A.M. on Channel 4, will show the reports, each about five minutes long, today through Friday. They are done by Jon Alpert, a freelance television journalist, whose reporting style makes him sound like a game-show host. In fact, the style is perfectly valid, a legitimate way of eliciting information. Many reporters sound that way when they are at work, although on television we seldom get to hear them.   Thus in this morning's segment, Mr. Alpert visits a ''re-education'' camp where 479 former officers in the South Vietnamese Army are interned. ''How are they treating you?'' Mr. Alpert asks the prisoners briskly, or ''Do you get enough to eat?'' Answers vary, although by and large camp life seems cheerful. The commandant smiles; prisoners have their own band.  Presumably, Mr. Alpert is at a model camp, freshly swept and scrubbed for his visit. Does this matter? This critic doesn't think it does. Few pieces of journalism, standing alone, give us the whole truth about a subject. Truth unfolds only over a period of time, usually through many stories. Mr. Alpert's reports are pieces in a mosaic.  In tomorrow's report, we see United States officials processing Vietnamese emigrants at the airport in Ho Chi Minh City. Clearly, they want to leave. On Wednesday, Mr. Alpert re-visits some of the same Vietnamese he interviewed in the 1970's. Apparently, their lives are unchanged.  On Thursday, Mr. Alpert visits a restaurant that employs war orphans. They work as cooks and waiters and use their salaries to pay for English lessons and electric guitars. They are touching. On Friday, we get the most entertaining, as well as least rewarding, report in the series: Mr. Alpert, more jovial than we want him to be, visits another restaurant. This one serves bats, snakes and armadillos.   The preview tapes supplied by NBC for the five reports were not fully edited. Some material was repetitious; introductory remarks were missing. Yet, it was clear that Mr. Alpert was reporting on a Vietnam that was neither as grim as other journalists have said, nor as hopeful as apologists have suggested.  In part, this is because Mr. Alpert's reports deal mostly with people, not policy. Government officials and old Army generals are absent. The Vietnamese we see and hear (English seems to be the second language) smile invitingly for the cameras. Often they mug. It is a useful reminder that people are much the same, no matter where they live. Mr. Alpert is giving us a worthwhile look at a country that for the most part is still shrouded.

"    Representative John McCain, an Arizona Republican serving his second term in Congress, may not be a household name to most Americans but is apparently becoming one in Vietnam.

They dropped by the Hanoi lake into which Mr. McCain tumbled when his Navy plane was shot down in 1967. There they found an impressive monument bearing the likeness of a uniformed American and an inscription in Vietnamese saying that on Oct. 26, 1967, the People's Army had shot down ''the famous air pirate'' John McCain.

"      Houston's public housing authority has systematically funneled Vietnamese refugees into an inner-city housing project to lessen opposition to a plan to clear and develop the property, a prime piece of downtown real estate, a court document suggested today.  The document, a report prepared for the housing authority, suggested that the ''steering'' arose from a belief that black or Hispanic-American residents could more effectively protest demolition of the project.  The Housing Authority of the City of Houston has subsequently been evicting tenants and boarding up the units.  The housing authority's actions were described by two volunteer lawyers for some of the Vietnamese tenants as they began arguments in a lawsuit filed in state district court to halt the evictions.  'Not True,' Director Says  Questioned in court about the purported ''steering'' of Vietnamese to pave the way for demolition, Earl Phillips, executive director of the housing authority, replied, ''That's not true.'' He also said Vietnamese residents who were being evicted were living there illegally.  The lawyers for the Vietnamese charge that the housing authority is purposely letting the 1,000-unit Allen Parkway Village public housing project deteriorate to the point that the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development will have no choice but to allow the city to tear it down. The Federal agency has ultimate control over the project's fate.  The housing authority formally voted in November 1983 to tear down the 41- year-old projet, maintaining that renovation would be too expensive and that the land on which it is situated would be better used for income-generating development.  Funds for Project's Renewal  However, critics of the city's plan observe that the housing authority had earlier refused to spend more than $10 million earmarked by the Federal Government to renew the project, and contend the authority had chose instead a plan of willful neglect  The project lies along Buffalo Bayou and Allen Parkway in an attractive area that developers, at the peak of Houston's economic boom, said should be ideal for office and residential development.  Today, an internal technical report prepared for the housing authority was introduced as evidence to suggest that changes in the ethnic makeup of the project's residents were no accident.  The report said that the project was originally built exclusively for whites, the largest of its kind in the South at the time, but that as racial barriers were gradually lifted the project by 1976 was 66 percent black, 3 percent Hispanic, 26 percent white and 5 percent Indochinese.  ''However,'' the report continues, ''the period between 1976 and 1983 has seen the project go from two-thirds black to more than one half Indochinese. It is unlikely that this demographic change in tenant population was due to random assignment from the waiting list.''  Instead, the report says, ''the 'steering' of Indochinese residents to Allen Parkway Village appears to have been an attempt to isolate the project from the Fourth Ward and the large black Houston community and to defuse the issue (possible sale of the public housing project) as a political concern.''  Less 'Fallout' Seen  The report says later that ''a decision to demolish a project that houses Vietnamese refugees would cause less political 'fallout' than the same decision to tear down a project housing mostly black families.''  Mr. Phillips conceded that the technical report cited was a part of the housing authority's files and was prepared under its auspices.  But ''it doesn't necessarily mean that I agree with it,'' said Mr. Phillips, who has been the executive director since 1982.  Mr. Phillips, who is black, maintained that the Vietnamese the housing authority was trying to evict ''are considered squatters who are there illegally.''  In some cases, Vietnamese tenants who originally occupied units at Allen Parkway Village simply passed them on to other members of their families when they left, leaving the new tenants without official certification.  Michol O'Connor, a lawyer for the Vietnamese, said that many of these unofficial transfers of housing units had been sanctioned by a former employee of the housing authority, a Vietnamese who was the only staff member able to speak the language. She said in court that that employee had since been dismissed amid allegations of bribery.  Mr. Phillips said that whether the Vietnamese tenants understood the situation or not, the former employee ''was not acting for the housing authority, he was acting for himself.''  However, Miss O'Connor read into the record a statement from the minutes of the housing authority in which Mr. Phillips conceded the authority had some responsibility for the Vietnamese being there.  Neighborhood organizations and other critics of the plan to tear down the housing project maintain that the housing authority has inflated the projected costs of renovation of the two- story garden apartment units in order to justify their demolition.  Lawyers for the Vietnamese said that the housing authority had boarded up at least 296 of the 905 units.   LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: photo of refugees                      ",March 19 1985 ,0

"    HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Oct. 17 -  Vietnam, encouraged by progress being made in talks with the United States on missing Americans, is now pressing for a resolution of another issue: the thousands of Amerasian children still in Vietnam.  A decade after the Communist takeover of South Vietnam, Hanoi and Washington continue to accuse each other of obstructing or delaying the movement of these children, the offspring of Vietnamese mothers and Americans here during the war.  Many of the children are approaching the age of majority, 18 years in Vietnam. If they are declared citizens, many would be subject to military service. A few may have already been conscripted, an official said.  The authorities say that some of the teen-agers are causing social problems. Called ''con lai'' or ''half-breeds'' in Vietnamese, the uncounted homeless among them roam the streets of this city, formerly called Saigon, begging from foreigners and clinging to Americans in the hope of a miraculous escape.  Private Action Favored  Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, meeting in Hanoi last week with a group of American war veterans led by two New York State Assemblymen, said Vietnam would be willing to discuss the emigration of the children with a private American team instead of on a government-to-government basis if that would speed the process.  ''Submit a plan in one month,'' he said. ''Send the delegation here, and we will talk. These are not refugees. These are your children. I would welcome anyone to come and take them away.''  He repeated his Government's opposition to the system under which the children now leave Vietnam under the Orderly Departure Program administered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  American and Vietnamese officials estimate the number of children and their immediate relatives - usually a mother left behind by a departing American and sometimes brothers, sisters and a stepfather - at 8,000 to 20,000. The Vietnamese say that the figure could be higher.  New Yorkers Are Urged to Act  The New Yorkers, on an eight-day visit to Vietnam, heard the same plea from all the officials they have met: Get these children out of Vietnam.  The New York delegation visiting Vietnam was led by Assemblyman John L. Behan, Republican of Montauk, and Dennis T. Gorski, Democrat of Buffalo. Also in the group were Wayne P. Jackson, the sergeant-at-arms of the State Assembly, and John Kilbride, a police officer and head of the Policemen's Benevolent Association in Freeport, L.I.  Accompanying the delegation as private citizens were Leo Dorsey, a member of the nongovernmental United States Committee for Refugees and the director of aid programs in the former South Vietnam for the Unitarian Church, and Robert Minnich, a former alternate-service volunteer in South Vietnam and now a consultant on refugee matters in Washington. Both have been interviewers for the Orderly Departure Program.  Dorsey to Try to Form Group  Mr. Dorsey said in an interview after the group met with Mr. Thach that he would try to form a delegation to take up the Foreign Minister's offer of talks.  ''The Vietnamese appear to want to resolve this issue even more quickly than the M.I.A. issue,'' Mr. Dorsey said, referring to the missing in action.  Vietnam says 7,300 Amerasians and relatives have left in the last three years since the United Nations-administered emigration process was devised. According to Nguyen Phi Tuyen, head of the consular section of Ho Chi Minh City's External Relations Service, 3,304 others have been given exit papers, but have not yet been interviewed by United States authorities, whose bureaucratic procedures he criticized.  United States records in Bangkok show 1,400 on the waiting list. Americans involved in the program acknowledge that rigorous standards of proof and Government-imposed refugee quotas have slowed entry.  American interviewers say there have been cases of abuse in the past involving Vietnamese buying an Amerasian child as a ticket to emigration. They also say Vietnamese authorities often hold up a departure by refusing to allow all family members to go.  Eight Years at the Present Rate  Mr. Dorsey said that at the present rate of emigration, it would take at least eight years to resettle the Amerasians.  He added that the Amerasian Act enacted by Congress to speed the process was flawed in demanding unrealistic promises of support from sponsors. Because of this, he said, no children from Vietnam entered the United States under the law in 1984. The 80 who were admitted all came under a program paid for by American Jesuits.  Under the present refugee system, which the State Department had to turn to when it became clear the Amerasian Act would not help, the United States Government provides a per-capita grant of $550 per child to resettlement agencies who oversee a child's move.  Mr. Dorsey said that if donors in foundations, religious organizations or corporations could be found to provide money for private resettlement efforts, at least some children could be moved from Vietnam. But many refugee and resettlement workers would prefer, they say, to see the law amended so it could be more quickly applied.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",October 20 1985 ,0
"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Oct. 17   Vietnam is embarking on a series of substantial economic changes intended not only to relieve chronic shortages in goods and resources but also to speed up the collapse of the resilient free-enterprise sector in the South.  ''We want to tackle the problem of people who use their resources to manipulate the economy,'' Le Chi Tiet, a Communist Party leader in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, said in a recent interview with American reporters. ''Larger traders with private resources are trying to destabilize this city.''  Among the changes taking place are the replacement of the old currency with a devalued one to reduce undeclared wealth, the elimination of many Government subsidies, and the introduction of welfare benefits.  Vietnam, debt-ridden and with virtually no hard-currency reserves, is for the first time asking the United Nations Center on Transnational Corporations to help it build trade with Western countries, according to diplomats and regional economists.  Later this month Vietnam will welcome a delegation of more than 50 top executives of large American corporations who are traveling through Asia on a tour sponsored by the publishers of Time and Life magazines.  Officials here and in Hanoi say they do not expect any immediate concrete results from the visit. The country has too many serious structural weaknesses to attract or absorb large-scale investment, and the United States, which has no diplomatic relations with Vietnam, is leading an effective trade embargo.  Hotel Being Repaired  Nevertheless, a sizable staff of Foreign Ministry officials is working full time on the two-day visit, and crews in Hanoi are busy sprucing up the lakeside Thang Loi hotel, where the delegation will spend one night.  Economists and diplomats in Hanoi and other Southeast Asian capitals say they believe Vietnam has been carefully watching Peking's economic experiments. ''They may be moving toward the Chinese model,'' one expert said, ''but of course they will not talk about it in those terms.''  China has been a traditional enemy and relations are tense. If Hanoi is seeking to expand international trade and investment activities, it is - unlike China - concurrently attempting to gain tighter control over the domestic economy.  Economists and diplomats in the region say there is a need to marshal the country's slim resources. Despite economic incentives that have benefited rural people in particular, untold amounts of money and goods are being diverted from Government coffers through black marketeering and corruption. And these problems are not confined to the uncooperative South.  Mr. Tiet said subsidized commodities such as petroleum and basic foodstuffs were being collected by ration-coupon holders for resale or other private business uses. He said that in some cases people entitled to food for their families at prices that represented a substantial loss to the Government were fattening livestock with it for sale on the private market. Government gasoline, he said, was running free-enterprise jitneys.  The rationing system has now been abandoned and workers are beginning to get additional pay or bonuses instead of subsidized goods. This has the added advantage of putting more money into the hands of Government workers and soldiers who were falling well behind farmers in income.  Here in Ho Chi Minh City a visitor returning six months after the celebrations marking the fall of South Vietnam to the armies of the North sees changes almost immediately.  Several street markets have shrunk. More shops and small businesses have been collectivized or forced into joint ventures with the Government. Formerly friendly shopkeepers, now working side-by-side with Government-assigned partners, are reluctant to talk to foreigners. Several took Western visitors aside to warn them they were being followed.  One craftsman told a visitor that he felt as if he were ''the last private trader in the city.''  Vendors and Pawn Brokers  Mr. Tiet, who is the head of the City Council Secretariat and leader of the Communist Party unit on the council, said ''only about twenty to thirty thousand people or households'' in a metropolitan area of about four million remain in private trade. Most, he said, were food and beverage vendors or pawn brokers.  ''How long these activities should last, we don't know,'' he said. ''They will go on until we can provide people with better facilities and services.'' He added that about 70 percent of the city's renascent handicrafts industry was now also collectivized.  Recent visitors to Ho Chi Minh City got a firsthand look at the sabotage tactics Mr. Tiet cited in his criticism of private traders and ''rich people.'' Shops and restaurants, including those under Government control, have been hoarding small denominations of currency, refusing to produce change for customers who pay with larger notes. This has in effect made larger notes unusable and kept them out of circulation, leading to rumors that they would be recalled.  The new Vietnamese dong was introduced in September at the rate of 10 units of old currency for one new one. Security procedures were tight; the country was sealed off for several days, with international flights canceled. The official exchange rate for old currency was 100 dong to the dollar. No new rate was announced in September but it is now known to be 15 new dong. The black market in new currency is already paying four to six times that rate.

"      The United States said today that Hanoi had agreed to the first joint American-Vietnamese search of a B-52 crash site in a move toward settling the issue of 2,446 Americans missing in Southeast Asia since the Vietnam War.  A Navy spokesman, Comdr. James Cossey, also released the identities of the remains of 10 Americans turned over by Hanoi on Aug. 14, one of them a civilian who died in captivity in a ''re-education'' camp in 1976.  Commander Cossey said Hanoi's first such agreement to allow joint American-Vietnamese excavation of a crash site near Hanoi was ''a positive step'' and a sign that Vietnam wanted to fulfill its promise to settle the missing in action issue within two years.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   It was in many ways a painful odyssey, marked now and then by tension and tears. Four New York veterans of Vietnam, the first state delegation to make such a trip, had returned to this country on public and personal quests.  They wanted to talk about public concerns - dioxin, Amerasian children, divided families and missing comrades. But they also wanted to see Vietnam, meet the Vietnamese and, in the safety of peace and the distance of time, talk about the war.  It was a mixed group that arrived at Hanoi's small airport on Oct. 9.  John L. Behan, an Assemblyman from Montauk, L.I., and the marshal this year of the first Vietnam veterans' parade ever in New York City, lost both his legs on Hill 55, south of Da Nang, nearly 20 years ago.  With Dennis T. Gorski, an Assemblyman from Buffalo. Mr. Behan had won state financing for the trip, and the pair hoped to help reunite some of their Vietnamese constituents with family members left behind, to learn how the defoliant Agent Orange had affected the Vietnamese and to see if they could help the Amerasians. The Vietnamese Government assured them that it would look into some of the concerns they raised.  Discovering a Country  Mr. Behan, energetic and good-humored, drew out Vietnamese amputees to confide in him.  Mr. Gorski, a quiet, contemplative man and the only former officer in the group, used the trip to clarify history for himself and to ask the Vietnamese about how things were going now.  Wayne Jackson, the Assembly's sergeant-at-arms and the only former Army member in the party of ex-Marines, was shaken by what he felt was his discovery of Vietnam, the country, not the war.  ''How the kids love water buffalos!'' he said, recalling how he and his fellow soldiers used to shoot the animals. ''They used to charge us, come right at us - at anything in green.''  Long Term in Vietnam  Later, disturbed at the sight of Amerasian children begging in the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, and by tiny, deformed toddlers in an orphanage, he wept.  The fourth member of the group, John Kilbride, who spent the longest time in Vietnam of any member of the delegation - November 1967 until August 1969 - is a policeman and head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association in Freeport, L.I.  He is a man who does not ornament his words. Of the efforts of the American soldiers, he said: ''We were the guys who did it. We didn't romanticize it or politicize it. We did it.''  'A Just Reason'  Do Vietnam's Vietnam veterans suffer stress? Le Binh, director of veterans affairs in the Vietnamese Social Welfare Ministry, did not seem to understand the question.  From across the table laden with tea cups and fruit, the Americans rephrased the query. ''Are there psychological problems caused by war? Do you have mental illness?'' Mr. Binh then replied: ''Oh, no. We have no such problems. Our soldiers fought for a just reason.''  After a discussion of comparative veterans' benefits, campaigns and the ongoing war in Cambodia, the meeting ended, and Mr. Binh, also an amputee, joined Mr. Behan to talk about exercise and other concerns of people with prosthetic devices.  Before parting, the Vietnamese veteran pointed to his head. ''We do have problems, here, too,'' he said quietly to Mr. Behan. The two men shook hands warmly and went their separate ways.  Asking About the Past  It was at the veterans affairs office, a dignified French colonial building on a shaded street in Hanoi, that Mr. Gorski unexpectedly found himself face to face with Trinh Cot.  The two men had been on opposite sides of the Perfume River in the ferocious battle for Hue in 1968. As they talked, it became apparent they may have been in direct combat. Mr. Gorski had many questions. First, ''did the North Vienamese forces, headquartered in the ancient Citadel, know that Americans were reluctant to bomb the historic building?''  Mr. Cot replied, through an interpreter, ''We understood that.''  The second question, ''Why were so many people massacred while Communist forces were in the city for 26 days?'' The journalist and historian Stanley Karnow has concluded that as many as 3,000 people perceived as enemies of Hanoi died in a pogrom, while Western attention was focused on the My Lai massacre.  The Vietnamese Communists have offered a number of explanations.  ''The army of the old regime executed these people,'' Mr. Cot said. ''They came to Hue and killed their fellow man in order to slander the North Vietnamese soldiers.''  ''I am sorry to be discourteous,'' Mr. Gorski replied, ''but I find that to be utter rubbish!''  Assessing American Soliders  Of Mr. Cot and another North Vietnamese soldier, Lieut. Col. Nguyen Dinh Lieu, the group asked what the Vietnamese had thought of the American fighters.  ''In 1965, when they first came, we thought they were the most well-equipped force in the world,'' Mr. Cot said. ''But we studied them. We saw our light equipment gave us flexibility. Most important, we believed.''  Colonel Lieu reflected for a minute, and added: ''We watched the American soldiers, and we evaluated their strength. We began to fear them less. We saw women combing the hair of the American soldiers. We saw them bathing in the afternoon. And we understood our evaluation was right.''  That night at dinner, Mr. Kilbride remarked: ''We thought we were men then. Hell, we were only boys.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo of John L.

"   , Vietnam   A resident ambassador calls it Hanoi's ''simply lovely'' season - the weeks between the stifling months of summer and winter's dismal, bitter chill. The sky is blue, the air fresh, and the streets are full of activity.  In the morning people jog, exercise in parks and squares and seem to dawdle on the way to work. By evening, a magician has appeared on the steps of the Central Bank, where an energetic band has swung into ''Besame Mucho.'' Couples draw closer in the dusk.  ''Streets very bicycle,'' a pedicab driver explains cheerily as he swerves in the twilight to avoid a pedaling teen-ager wearing a T-shirt that says ''Cheech and Chong.'' On a downtown corner, a vendor with several dozen mugs is selling beer from a tub.  This year the change in atmosphere may be more than just seasonal, some longtime residents of the city say. Visitors returning after six months or a year of absence tend to agree.  Lipstick Is Back  There are still bullock carts where other Asian cities would have cars, but there are also more motorbikes, more fashionably dressed young people, and more women in rainbows of soft ao dais, the traditional Vietnamese tunics and trousers that were once seen less frequently among the black pajamas. Lipstick and jewelry are making comebacks.  Some of Hanoi's new look has to do with the city's celebration in September of the 40th anniversary of the declaration of independence from France. Squares were repaved, buildings painted, and a cluster of picturesque but derelict shops around the city's central lake removed to make more room for grass and park benches.  Other changes grow out of new economic policies that appear to be taking into account, at least for the moment, the grumbles of long-suffering consumers.  Many North Vietnamese have gone south over the last decade to have a look at Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, and have come back fascinated by its looser and more prosperous-looking way of life. Is the Grass Greener in China?  A lot of people, diplomats say, also have an eye on China's ''modernizations.'' Foreign visitors are often asked for details about developments there, and whether life has improved as much as they have heard.  In one of those chance encounters that seem more frequent in Hanoi these days, a senior army officer in uniform struck up a conversation in French with a visitor in a city park. After talking a little about his relatives in Texas and California, he suddenly began to muse about his impending retirement and how, after nearly 40 years in the army - he joined at the age of 17 to fight the French - he could look forward to only more hardship in old age.  ''There is never enough food,'' he said, patting his lean rib cage. ''We live five in one room, and there is no peace. Something is wrong with our economy.''  The runaway hit of the theatrical season is ''Me and Us,'' a satire on petty-minded bureaucrats who get in the way of progress. Tickets, like everything else, are for sale on the black market, and there are reports that the company is looking for a bigger theater.  The play, by Luu Quang Yu, got by the censors, the knowledgeable say, because it is essentially in line with criticisms made by Hanoi's economic pragmatists, who have been in the ascendancy since a party meeting in June.  The play, which originated in Ho Chi Minh City (where it won an award) and has been televised nationally, ridicules the sycophancy of party officials, make-work jobs, endless political meetings and ritualistic jargon.  Audiences seem to empathize with the tragic hero who is clobbered by the system for showing initiative. As a line in the play puts it: he was ''wrong to be right too soon.''  It is a lively season in literature, too, with the most popular books said to be stories of life in the countryside, where the successful policies of the pragmatists coexist with unpopular political drives to collectivize.  A reporter asked a Vietnamese official to describe a particular book that is making the rounds among Vietnamese in Bangkok.  ''It's about how everything goes wrong,'' he said with a wan smile.  There is a building boom of sorts in progress in Hanoi. A diplomat said it was a result of the Government's decision to loosen controls over construction materials, and release bricks and other long absent items for private purchase. On several streets piles of waiting bricks and cement were destined to become restaurants, workers said. In the countryside, farmers build bigger houses.  The freeing of construction materials came at about the time the central Government decided to make some drastic changes in the way its employees, a large percentage of the work force in this srictly controlled Communist economy, were paid. Ration coupons to be exchanged for goods were abolished and wages at least theoretically increased.  Civil servants are sometimes wary of new policies and divided about whether they will work. Several said they now had more money to spend and valued the greater freedom of choice in making purchases. Others said they did not expect significant improvement in their lives.  ''We still all have to have two jobs,'' a Government interpreter said.  A young Vietnamese woman from Europe, back for the first time in more than 12 years to visit her elderly father, said she was saddened that life was no easier than it had been in wartime.  ''My country is beautiful,'' she said. ''But the people have no time to look at beautiful things.''  Having a foreign connection is becoming as much an asset in Hanoi as it has long been in the south, where relatives abroad supply many luxuries and sometimes the necessities of life.  In Hanoi some commodities that find their way to market stalls are from the Soviet-bloc countries, where young people go to work or study.  Vietnamese laugh at Western reports that they are sent there as forced labor to repay the country's mammoth debts to Moscow and its allies. On the contrary, they say, so popular are the work assignments that people pay bribes to get them. Going to Poland or Czechoslovakia can mean a down jacket or tape deck at the very least.  More Western goods are also finding their way here from Thailand, Japan, Europe and the United States.  In an embroidery shop, where a visitor startled the sales staff by saying she had come to buy a blouse, not change money - the real business of most private traders, it seems - stylish dresses made of American fabric were produced from a back room. So were T-shirts embroidered with American cartoon characters.  The shop manager, spurred by the customer's comments on the high quality of the work, plunged into a display cabinet, scattering bits of cloth, and emerged with a pile of fashion catalogues from Frankfurt, Stockholm and Los Angeles.  ''Everything comes from the West or Hong Kong,'' he said. ''Many Russian ladies shop here.''  Sometimes Hanoi's two societies, the secretive Government and the curious people, intersect jarringly for a brief second. One recent morning, a bicyclist pulled up alongside two Americans in ''cyclo'' pedicabs and began the litany of ''where from'':  Russia? Sweden? Germany? America! ''I used to teach physics in Newark, New Jersey,'' he said in English. ''I came home in 1971,'' he added, doffing a smart straw hat as he cruised along.  He had begun drifting animatedly into reminiscences of New York, when he suddenly halted in mid-sentence and pedaled off, his face without expression and his eyes straight ahead as if he had never seen the strangers.  Beneath the next shade tree was a policeman.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: photo of Hanoi residents (NYT/Barbara Crossette)                      ",November 1 1985 ,0
"      The Pentagon announced today that American investigators would excavate a bomber crash site near Hanoi later this month, the first time Vietnam has allowed Americans to participate in the search for remains of missing servicemen since the war ended in 1975.  Pentagon officials and representatives of families of the missing said the agreement was a significant breakthrough in the effort to account for the 2,441 Americans still listed as missing in action in Indochina, most of them in Vietnam.  Assistant Defense Secretary Richard L. Armitage said a team including 11 Americans and 10 Vietnamese would participate in the examination of the site where a B-52 with a crew of six went down in December 1972.  Mr. Armitage also disclosed today that American experts had identified 5 more of 26 sets of remains turned over the by Vietnamese in August. He said one of the men, Lieut. Richard C. Sather of Pomona, Calif., was the first American shot down over North Vietnam.Lieutenant Sather's plane was shot down Aug. 5, 1964, the Pentagon said.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   Do Hoang Hai says that when he was a South Vietnamese student activist in the 1960's he specialized in leading attacks against the United States Embassy in Saigon. But today, Saigon has become Ho Chi Minh City, and Mr. Hai, the deputy director of its Import-Export Corporation, works to bring American trade and investment back to Vietnam.  A decade after North Vietnamese troops unified the country, and despite years of Soviet assistance, Vietnam is a poor nation in need of hard-currency trade and Western aid, diplomats in the region say. If Washington were to lead the way, they add, other industrialized nations would follow. But how is Hanoi to deal with Washington?  In the first place, the United States wants Vietnam out of Cambodia, which it has occupied since December 1978. Though the United Nations General Assembly approved again last week, by the largest margin in seven years, a call for the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces, most diplomats doubt that Hanoi can be moved from that strategic buffer nation. Diplomats and international agency officials close to the Vietnamese believe, however, that Hanoi has decided to try to remove some of the more negotiable obstacles to diplomatic ties and better feelings. These include requests for a more credible accounting of missing Americans, release of Amerasian children who want to leave and the reopening of discussions on a Reagan Administration offer to resettle the inmates of political prison camps.  However, things are not going well with Washington, and this seems to puzzle the Vietnamese. Visitors sometimes come away with the sense that many Vietnamese, living on the rhetoric of the 1960's, are unaware how much the world - and America - have changed, how much sympathy for them has disappeared in the gap between the Chicago Seven and Rambo. Or it may be a matter of a proud people being unwilling to alter its tactics.  Mr. Hai, asks American reporters for ''the same understanding we got from the media during the war.'' Young people, raised to believe that a peasant army ''defeated the greatest, most sophisticated military power,'' cannot understand why Hanoi has become a pariah at the United Nations and lost old friends among developing nations. They cannot fathom why American guilt has not been translated into help with rebuilding.  The conflict between pressing economic realities and the suspicion directed at Washington make this a critical time. Diplomats and aid officials are watching the exploratory talks between Vietnamese and Americans, as well as concurrent Vietnamese overtures to China, for signs of a new willingness to be accomodating.  There has been progress, albeit slow, on the missing Americans. The first joint excavation of a wartime plane crash site, tentatively promised for March, is now to be held this month. Meetings get postponed without explanation; one is now scheduled for Wednesday.  Hanoi continues to ask that thousands of Amerasian children now reaching maturity be taken away.  But it seems cool to approaches by nongovernmental Americans. ''It's about time the Vietnamese demonstrated some good will,'' said Charles Printz of Human Rights Advocates International, after Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach offered to deal with private American groups. Mr. Printz said that his organization of 300 lawyers had offered to help devise a legal way of moving the children but that its letters to Hanoi had gone unanswered. Offers of assistance from American religious groups are also declined. Asked why the Mennonite Central Committee, which works in Cambodia, has been rebuffed, a Foreign Ministry official said Vietnam did not need the programs.  Hopes are also dim for the resettlement of inmates from what Hanoi once called ''re-education'' camps.  Vietnam first offered to allow the estimated 8,000 to 10,000 prisoners to emigrate, then backed off when Washington sought to negotiate procedures. Recently in Geneva, the United States again asked Vietnam to allow the prisoners to go.  Hanoi is widely believed to be holding out for diplomatic ties before freeing the detainees. A delegation of Vietnam veterans from New York State, led by two state assemblymen, recently asked if this were so. Mr. Thach, a master at Delphic replies, denied that Vietnam was linking the issue to diplomatic recognition.  ''After recognition the question could be discussed,'' he said. ''But this is not linkage.''

"   , Thailand, Nov. 13   American military officials arrived in Hanoi today to discuss the fate of American servicemen listed as missing in action in Vietnam and to excavate the crash site of a B-52 bomber in the first such joint effort of the United States and Vietnam.  The excavation at the site of the crash in 1972 will begin Monday, but will be preceded by talks aimed at locating other areas where remains of Americans may be found.  A total of 2,441 Americans are listed as misssing in action in Indochina, 1,797 of them in Vietnam and surrounding waters. Vietnam has turned over the remains of only 123 American servicemen since 1974, drawing strong criticism from United States officials.

"      The United States and Vietnam will hold talks on the highest level in nine years next Monday in Hanoi, the State Department announced today.  The purpose of the meeting is to lay the groundwork for resolving the problem of the nearly 1,800 Americans still unaccounted for in Vietnam.  Charles E. Redman, a department spokesman, said the United States hoped to build on ''the significant increase'' in cooperation that has become apparent.  The American team will be headed by Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense, and by Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Others in the group are Richard Childress, political and military affairs director of the National Security Council staff at the White House, and Anne Mills Griffiths, executive director of the League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. To Meet With Foreign Minister They will confer with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach and with a Deputy Foreign Minister, Hoang Bich Son, Mr. Redman said.  This is the latest in a series of recent moves toward tackling the emotionally charged issue of the Americans still not unaccounted for from the war. It is the highest-level American delegation to visit Vietnam since Leonard Woodcock, then the president of the United Auto Workers, visited Hanoi in 1977 on behalf of President Jimmy Carter, to discuss normalization of relations.  The United States lists 1,797 Americans as unaccounted for in Vietnam, 700 in the north and 1,097 in the south. In addition, 556 are listed as unaccounted for in Laos, 82 in Cambodia, and 6 in China, for a total of 2,441.  Of this total, half are listed on a roll of killed in action, but bodies not recovered. The other half is on the list of prisoners of war and missing in action, but the Pentagon regards all but one of them as legally dead.  The one American still regarded legally as missing or captured, is Col. Charles Shelton, an Air Force pilot, who is known to have been captured in Laos by Pathet Lao forces on April 29, 1965, a Pentagon spokesman said today. He is listed as missing or captured ''symbolically,'' the spokesman said, to demonstrate American interest in the issue.  Since the end of the Vietnam war in 1975, the United States has received over 800 reports of first-hand sightings of people who are possibly Americans in Indochina. The Pentagon, in a news release last month, said most of these cases had been resolved as either fabrications or involving Americans who had returned to the United States.  But 119 cases are still under investigation,'' it said.  Of these 119, there are 28 from North Vietnam, 74 from South Vietnam, 15 from Laos and 2 from Cambodia.  Until the issue is resolved, the United States Government takes the position that ''although we have been thus far been unable to prove that Americans are still detained against their will, the information available to us precludes ruling out that possibility.''  The United States has made this a priority issue before there can be discussion about the establishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam. The United States has also said that Vietnam would have to agree to a formula for withdrawing its 160,000 troops from Cambodia and allowing open elections there.  High-Level Talks Proposed  Vietnam said in July that it wanted the issue of the missing American resolved once and for all within two years.  It proposed high-level talks to discuss ways of dealing with the problem. The United States agreed and originally scheduled the Armitage-Wolfowitz mission for Aug. 23. But when Foreign Minister Thach said he had to go to Moscow on that date, only Mr. Childress and Mrs. Griffiths went to Hanoi.  After that visit, the State Department said Sept. 3 that the discussions had been ''the most positive'' to date.  There have since been follow-up talks between Mr. Childress and Vietnamese officials at the United Nations. And last month, a joint United States-Vietnam team searched for remains of Americans in a rural area six miles north of Hanoi where a B-52 bomber crashed in December 1972. That effort ended Dec. 1, with only slim hopes of identifying American servicemen from the unearthed bone fragments. Information About Crash Sites State Department officials said the United States had information about the sites of plane crashes and locations where Americans were seen being taken prisoner, and that increased efforts could make headway in clearing up many cases.  The Vietnamese have been handing over remains over the years. So far, 130 remains identified as Americans have been turned over since 1974, 17 from Laos, and 2 from Cambodia. There is a persistent belief, based on what is said to be plausible information from a Vietnamese refugee, that the remains of several hundred Americans are stored in a Hanoi warehouse mortuary. This has been denied by Vietnam.  In a related matter, the State Department announced that Laos had authorized a team of American technical specialists to examine a site where an Air Force AC-130 gunship crashed during the Vietnam war. A similar team was able to recover the remains of 13 Americans in an excavation last February.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 30 1985 ,2

Keith Schneider, an Army spokesman, said there were 35 other men listed as dying in captivity in South Vietnam whose remains had not been recovered.  Remains to Arrive on CoastIn releasing the names, the Pentagon said the six bodies would be transported by plane from Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii to California on Wednesday.  ''We appreciate this return of remains, and combined with the recent Vietnamese agreement to hold a minimum of six technical meetings per year, we hope it marks the beginning of the fulfillment of the Vietnamese pledges to accelerate their search efforts,'' the Pentagon said. It added the next meeting to discuss the return of additional bodies would be held April 17-20 in Hanoi.  Vietnam last returned the remains of eight people to the United States in July 1984. Six were later identified as Americans.  According to the Pentagon, before the latest identifications were made 2,483 Americans were listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia as a result of the Vietnam War. Hanoi has maintained it is not holding any American prisoners.  Since 1974 Hanoi has returned the remains of 93 Americans lost in Vietnam and in Laos. The remains of four others have not been identified as Americans.  1  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 9 1985 ,3
"    Capt. Michael Chwan, an Air Force flier from Bayonne, N.J., met Dana Bass at a party in February 1964, and they were married soon thereafter. Fourteen months later, in September 1965, his jet was shot down over North Vietnam. Mrs. Chwan was three months pregnant at the time.  On Tuesday, almost 20 years later, she was told that her husband's body had been identified as one of six returned in March by Vietnam.  ''I was shocked after 19 and a half years,'' Mrs. Chwan said. ''I never really expected that his body would be returned to be buried in American soil.'' She and relatives of the other servicemen voiced a sense of relief at the return of the remains.  Mrs. Chwan was not at her home in Tampa, Fla., when two Air Force officers arrived to tell her the news. Instead, they met her daughter, Michelle, now 19, who had never seen her father. ''I didn't think I would cry but I couldn't help it,'' Miss Chwan said.  Officials of the United States Pacific Command said the United States and Vietnam have agreed to meet in Hanoi for three days beginning April 17 for discussions on the possible return of more bodies.  102 Bodies Returned  To date, the Vietnamese have returned the remains of 102 people. Of these, 99 have been identified as missing Americans. An Air Force spokesman, Lieut. Col. Richard Stevenson, said that 2,477 Americans, including 42 civilians, lost in the war in Southeast Asis remained unaccounted for.  Besides Captain Chwan, the other servicemen whose remains were released in Hanoi March 20 by the Vietnamese Government were Col. Melvin J. Killian of the Air Force, of Council Bluffs, Iowa; Maj. Cleveland S. Harris of the Air Force, of Birmingham, Ala.; Maj. Chambliss Chesnutt of the Air Force, of Little Rock, Ark.; Sgt. Gerasimo Arroyo-Baez of the Army, of Maunabo, P.R., and Sgt. Robert Sherman of the Marines, of Danville, Ill.  The bodies were identified at the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu. Vietnamese authorities originally indicated that the remains of five men were being returned, but the investigators found that the remains of a sixth man also were included.  Wife Was Told of Crash  Mrs. Chwan said she never expected to see her husband alive again because another pilot told her he saw the plane crash and that the crew could not have survived.  Captain Chwan was the navigator of the F4-C fighter-bomber. The pilot was Major Chesnutt, whose remains also were returned Tuesday. Patti Chesnutt, his wife, who now lives in Houston, characterized the return of her husband's remains as ''the last chapter.''  ''I didn't know what to say 20 years ago,'' she said. ''I still don't know what to say.''  In Danville, Ill, David Sherman, 42, a brother of Sergeant Sherman, said the family had been notified in 1967, first that his brother was missing and later that he was a prisoner of war in South Vietnam. In 1968, the family was informed that the sergeant had died. Two years later, in 1970, two fellow prisoners who had been released told the family they had been with Sergeant Sherman when he died of malnutrition.  ''After 16 years, you figure he's over there and is going to stay over there,'' David Sherman said. ''You don't expect it when they say they're bringing your brother home.''  ''I can go to bed at night now and know where he is,'' said Clara Harris, the mother of Major Harris. ''Just not knowing, that's what hurts.''  Harold Killian, the brother of Colonel Killian, said he never thought his brother had survived. Mr. Killian, a retired Air Force colonel now living in San Diego, said his brother was flying a Thunderjet when he got hit. ''When they last saw him, his head and helmet were lying over against the canopy,'' he said. ''He was either dead or unconscious when the airplane hit the ground.''  Daughter in Flying School  Mr. Killian said his brother's nine children were grown now and that the youngest daughter, who was 18 months old when her father was shot down, is now in flying school.  The four Air Force fliers all died in crashes in the 1965-1968 period. Sergeant Arroyo-Baez, like Sergeant Sherman, died in captivity. The Pacific Command said it was the first time the Vietnamese had returned the remains of anyone who had died in captivity.  Sergeant Arroyo-Baez was 38 years old and serving his second tour of duty in Vietnam when he was taken prisoner March 24, 1969, but it was not until Oct. 15, 1976, that the Government in Vietnam said he had died in a prison camp. The announcement did not say how or when he died. He entered the Army in 1954 and was promoted to staff sergeant after his capture.  Sergeant Arroyo-Baez, the father of nine children, was married when he was 16 years old. His widow, Agustina Arroyo-Baez, said she was 15 at the time they were married. ''I now have 22 grandchildren,'' she said. ''I wish they had given more information about how and when he died.''   LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 11 1985 ,3
"   , Vietnam, April 20   Vietnam will allow a team of American experts to visit a B-52 crash site in June to examine the feasibility of recovering remains of missing Americans, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said today.  At a press conference for foreign journalists, he described the move as a special case and said it would only involve a preliminary survey.  He appeared to rule out similar visits in the future unless the United States moved toward normal relations.  The agreement to allow the American experts to visit the crash site at Gia Lam, 60 miles northeast of Hanoi, was reached after three days of talks here with United States officials.

"   , Md.   Donald Shay's father is retired now. Donald's little sister has two young children of her own. His fiancee finally married someone else. And Donald's mother doesn't bake his favorite apple pie much anymore; the good smell brings back too many bad memories.  Mr. Shay doesn't know any of this. And he may never know. In fact, his family may never know where he is, or where he was when he died, if he died. For Mr. Shay is one of 2,477 Americans still missing in action from the Vietnam War.  Ten years after the fall of Saigon and 15 years after that smiling, 24-year-old lacrosse player flew off a radar screen into his family's memory somewhere over Indochina, no one knows for sure what happened to any of the missing Americans.    More Than Mere Statistics  But in one of the more mysterious legacies of that painful era in American history, these men who went off to war as individuals have now become, as a group, much more than simply a sad statistic. They are the subject of movies, books and songs, the object of angry demonstrations, earnest petitions and solemn vigils, the focus of intense Presidential interest, microscopic analysis and secret satellite photography and the heart of some delicate diplomatic exchanges trying to bridge broad cultural chasms.  The alleged remains of some missing men, reduced to bones and fragments after years in the jungle, have even become the currency of a ghoulish, clandestine commerce that preys on the hopes and fears of families and refugees.  ''Somehow,'' said one United States Government official, ''the mystery of their disappearance and their deaths have taken on a peculiar life of their own.''  For military records, all but one of the missing are officially presumed dead, ending the pay, automatic promotion and service benefits accruing for years. Only the case of a single missing flier remains active for symbolic reasons. But for diplomatic records, the missing remain a live issue, a major obstacle to the normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United States and a lever for some Southeast Asian lands to keep the United States in the region as a political counterbalance.  For some family members, the missing relative is dead, a sad part of a slowly fading past that might somehow still miraculously reappear and complicate a brand new life. Other relatives still wait, in hope that their loved one might walk back through the door some day, perhaps tomorrow.  For the children of the missing, many of them not so childish anymore, the absent father is often but a dim memory, kept alive on den walls or treasured tape cassettes by sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers or wives, some of them remarried, some of them happy now, some of them troubled, all of them scarred.  ''It's been such a long time to be uncertain,'' said Ann Mills Griffiths, whose brother vanished in Vietnam nearly two decades ago. ''You want to be realistic. But you're afraid to give up hope.''  By the standards of war, America's 2,477 Vietnam missing are few, thanks to modern recovery methods, the nature of land fighting and new forensic technology that enables investigators to identify even partial remains by, for instance, electronically reconstructing a skull from a fragment.    Tallies of the Missing  The Center for Military History still lists 3,350 missing in action from World War I, 8,177 in Korea, where M.I.A. teams still mount occasional search excavations, and 78,777 from World War II, when many were lost at sea.  Of the Vietnam missing, 706 were in the Army, 937 in the Air Force, 500 in the Navy, 291 in the Marine Corps and 1 in the Coast Guard. The other 42 were civilians. Of the missing, 1,101 disappeared in or over South Vietnam, 719 in North Vietnam, 569 in Laos, 82 in Cambodia and 6 over China.  Privately, American officials and relatives admit there is little hope of accounting for many of the missing, perhaps even a majority, and most likely for all those who disappeared in Cambodia, the scene of almost continuous fighting since.  In addition, 1,186 of the total missing are really listed as Killed in Action- Body Not Recovered. These are, for instance, pilots whose planes were seen to crash with no parachutes or soldiers who were killed on patrol under circumstances in which comrades could not retrieve the body.  An unknown number will never be found because there are no remains to find. Last year when members of Congress pressured Lieut. Gen. James A. Williams, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, to tell them how many realistically might be found, he testified: ''Some of these people have disappeared by being completely obliterated. If you have ever watched an explosion disintegrate somebody, you would understand that that happens.''  A Lower Priority  A full accounting of both prisoners of war and missing was part of the 1973 Paris accords that arranged United States disengagement from the Vietnam conflict, where 58,022 Americans died. North Vietnam returned 591 prisoners in 1973, and another 134 returned or escaped at other times. But with the American withdrawal and the fall of Saigon 10 years ago this month, the missing got a lower priority by a Government and public eager to put the divisive war behind. Few remains were returned; 102 since 1973, including two non-Americans.  Two commissions reported to President Carter that there were no live American prisoners remaining in Indochina. And each military service moved administratively to declare all the missing dead.  What happened in 1980 was the election as President of Ronald Reagan, who as Governor of California spoke out often and emotionally for the need of a full accounting. He was photographed wearing one of the M.I.A. bracelets engraved with the name of a missing man and sold in the war to show symbolic support. The President still keeps five M.I.A. bracelets hanging in his study next to the Oval Office.  ''The way our system of government works,'' said one aide, ''if the President is personally interested in something, then the Government is interested in it. And Mr. and Mrs. Reagan are personally very interested in M.I.A.'s.''  New Place on Agenda  In the past four years this interest, displayed through numerous speeches and public references, through many private telephone calls and letters to M.I.A. families and through countless Reagan Administration meetings and a still-secret 10-point National Security Council strategy, has raised the subject to what the President calls ''the highest national priority.''  It has also left few Government officials willing to question the campaign or to be quoted by name. ''Few people in the Vatican,'' said one, ''would tell the Pope they question the faith.''  The broad public and private strategy has involved efforts to mobilize the Government's bureaucracy, the intelligence community and bipartisan political support to transmit a convincing signal to Hanoi that an accounting is necessary before any aid or normalizing of relations.  The President got an unusual security clearance for Mrs. Griffiths, the executive director of the National League of M.I.A.-P.O.W. Families. She now routinely attends relevant meetings of the National Security Council as well as diplomatic negotiations in New York and Hanoi.  One result has been to dissipate the harsh criticism the league has aimed at previous ''do-nothing'' Administrations. ''For a while,'' said Mrs. Griffiths, a Californian whose organization says it has 3,000 M.I.A. family members and 15,000 concerned people as supporters, ''our families felt they were fighting their own Government as well as the Vietnamese.''  But another result, tied in with a growing public willingness to address the emotional legacies of the war, has been the eager involvement of a variety of groups and individuals who profess patriotism but have at times complicated diplomatic efforts. ''It's a very thin line,'' said one Administration strategist.  Veterans Groups' Actions  Veterans groups have helped gather millions of petition signatures demanding accountings of the missing from the Vietnamese, and they recently provided the Hanoi Government with details on some unmarked burial sites of its missing. One small group has staged a round-the-clock vigil at the Vietnam Memorial since Dec. 24, 1982.  Others, however, have burned Vietnamese flags before that country's mission to the United Nations, while some groups raise money from Americans to mount ''rescue raids,'' which produced no verifiable results and complicated official talks.  What seems to capture the public imagination on the missing is the lingering uncertainty about their fate and, in the view of some, a wishful willingness to believe any scrap of information and to distrust any Vietnamese denials about remaining prisoners of war.  ''We have returned everyone,'' Le Kim Chung, Vietnam's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, said in an interview. ''Also, why would we want to keep them? We have enough troubles without keeping Americans.''  Mr. Le also denounced as fabrications refugee reports of caches of American remains. One Vietnamese undertaker who fled to the United States told Congress he saw 400 such remains in a Hanoi warehouse, which many in Washington believe.  Sightings of Whites  What has proven most tantalizing to M.I.A. families and the 18 Defense Intelligence Agency analysts assigned full time to sifting data about the missing are reports of ''live sightings,'' usually from refugees, of a white in Indochina in a particular place on a particular date. According to Col. Gerald S. Venanzi, a former prisoner of war who is the Pentagon's senior authority on the missing, there have been more than 750 reported sightings since 1973, some of prisoners and some of men free of visible restraints.  All refugee camps have multilingual posters seeking information about the missing. Those responding are interviewed by special teams, sometimes using polygraphs, or lie detectors. ''We have him describe his village, his house, where he saw the Caucasian,'' said one intelligence official who sought anonymity. ''With computers we can cross-check his identity with other refugees from the same village. And with satellites we can photograph the place right down to the fence in his yard.''  Analysts believe some stories are fabrications planted by Vietnamese to discredit refugee reports and consume valuable tracking resources. Other reports turn out to be Europeans or stem from refugees seeking favorable immigration treatment. There is no pattern to the sightings, but 175 such reports remain unresolved, prompting officials to say they cannot rule out the possibility some prisoners remain.  Should live Americans be found, officials said, the President has authorized any means necessary to extricate them. ''This could range from diplomacy to black helicopters in the night,'' said one official.  'Maybe He's Better Dead'  Edna Hicks clings to such reports as proof that her son Terrin, a 31-year-old pilot when his plane was downed over North Vietnam in 1968, could be alive. ''It'd be a miracle, a long shot, I know,'' said Mrs. Hicks, now 70 years old, who sometimes still speaks of her son in the present tense. ''Some days you feel he's alive. Some days not. And then you think, what would he be like after 17 years of imprisonment and torture? Maybe he's better dead.''  To some, the inability of such vast intelligence capabilities to confirm the existence of a live American prisoner is proof that none exist and suggests the Administration is using rhetoric to fuel false hopes.  The Administration's known interest is also fueling a brisk border business in bones, as refugees, resistance forces and others appear, usually in Thailand, with plastic bags purportedly containing American remains, some of which are really animal bones. Various forms of military identification have also been offered, some belonging to American soldiers long since safely home.  That is how Nicholas Brooks of Newburgh, N.Y., finally came home 12 years after parachuting from his stricken plane over Laos. His remains were delivered to Bangkok by a Lao resistance member and identified at a special military laboratory in a concrete-block warehouse in Honolulu. Technicians there can determine age, sex, race, blood type and basic stature even from partial remains. Physical characteristics such as height, weight, broken bones and dental records for all the missing have been computerized.  Using other Asian governments and the United Nations for pressure, the Reagan Administration continues negotiations for the return of M.I.A.'s from Laos, where a joint excavation team recovered remains from an American crash site in February, and from Vietnam, which turned over the remains of six others in March.  Outlook Seems to Improve  Detailed files for each man, concentrating on cases believed most physically accessible, are turned over to Vietnamese at meetings in a sparsely furnished Foreign Ministry room in Hanoi. The Vietnamese, citing humanitarian reasons and saying families of the missing are victims of the war like themselves, recently agreed to increase these sessions to a minimum of six a year. Both sides say they detect increasing cooperation. One United Nations official called it ''a definite defrosting'' of the M.I.A. issue with a ''mounting momentum'' that also affords Vietnam a window from its diplomatic isolation.  In regular visits to Hanoi and quiet dinners in New York, American officials seek to quicken the pace of returns, calling it ''good-will money in the bank'' for future Vietnamese- American relations.  Mr. Le says the process will take time, that Vietnam has 300,000 missing of its own, that it lacks recovery resources and that a proper American attitude would speed things. He cites as ''unhelpful'' and Reagan aides describe as ''unnecessary'' a recent House rider to provide $5 million in arms for Cambodian rebels fighting Vietnamese forces. Mr. Le said diplomatic relations, as the United States has with Laos, would be necessary for joint excavations.  The United States is known to have suggested instead that American experts survey crash and burial sites for an excavation estimate, which the Administration will pay.  ''The war is over,'' said Mr. Le. ''We want to look straight ahead to the future and a new chapter in relations between our two countries.''  Donald Shay's mother here, Sara Frances, does not like to talk about the Vietnamese authorities. For a while she wrote many foreign governments, even Laotian royalty, about her missing son, and she went to Thailand. She also immersed herself in M.I.A. league work.  Donald was home on leave in the summer of 1970 when he proposed to Jane Morris, a stewardess. They had met in college. They agreed to marry in December at the end of his photo- reconnaissance tour in Thailand.  In a conversation the next day in the Shay family's backyard on Hilltop Road under the big maple tree that had grown up with the Shay youngsters, Donald Shay's sister, now Mary Louisa Rutledge, suggested that the couple marry immediately during the leave.  Prospects of Widowhood  ''As if he could see into the future,'' Lieutenant Shay's sister recalled the other day, ''he said: 'No, we'll wait till I get back. I'd never want to make her a widow.' ''  Four months later, one month before his combat tour was to end, Donald Shay disappeared. The engagement ring arrived in the mail a few days later. Eighteen months ago Janet Morris married someone else. ''I have my own son now,'' she said, ''and I know how a mother feels.''  For several years Dr. and Mrs. Shay held out strong hopes for their only son's return. The optimism has faded. ''I no longer think I'm going to hear from him tomorrow,'' said Mrs. Shay, who still wears her son's M.I.A. bracelet. ''But I won't accept that he's dead until I hear something definitive.''  Mrs. Shay's daughter, an opponent of the war, gave up hope for her brother sooner. ''The uncertainty was like ripping off a big bandage every day,'' she said. And so the other day when her 6-year-old son, Donald, pointed at his uncle's photo in the den and asked who it was, Mrs. Rutledge didn't say anything about M.I.A.'s or P.O.W.'s or Government negotiations or radar screens. ''That's Mommy's brother,'' she said. ''He's not living anymore.''

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, April 27   Workers scaled utility poles to unfurl the red flag of a unified Vietnam, and young men and women marched through the twilight at the end of a working day to the final rehearsal tonight of the big parade.  Ten years ago on  Tuesday, this city collapsed before Hanoi's army and its local allies, the Vietcong.  Nguyen Van Tang was a Vietcong. Now a 54-year-old colonel in the Vietnamese Army, he talked today about how he had worked as a plumber and a house painter to study potential bombing targets in the city.  Col. Dieu Dan Bhong, 60, drove a cyclo, or pedicab, as cover for his intelligence-gathering work. Lieut. Col. Doung Long Sing, who said he was responsible for planning many attacks in the city, also brought in the explosives by public transportation.  A Sense of Exploitation  Stories of these and other ''heroes and heroines of the revolution'' that met reporters at the headquarters of the city's military command drew a profile of the Vietnamese insurgent. All said they were recruited while still in their teens. All had felt some sense of exploitation, they said, often by French colonizers of Vietnam, who, they said, denied them education and a better life.  Capt. Pham Thi My, 32, said she joined the insurrection at 13 because some of her friends had been ''raped by G.I.'s.''  The older officers spoke with amusement at the memory of their specialty - infiltrating, according to Colonel Sing, ''people who we knew would please Americans'' into jobs at United States installations.  Occasionally, the memories of the old combatants were jogged by visiting American reporters. A 1965 attack on the United States Embassy left ''no civilian casualties,'' a Vietnamese officer said.  ''I was there and I saw them - Vietnamese casualties in the street, in the cafe,'' a reporter said.  A Vietnamese officer replied that, ''bullets have no eyes'' and suggested that the Vietnamese victims may have been shot by embassy guards.  Asked what opinion they had formed of the American fighting man, a Vietnamese officer said: ''The soldier has a rifle. But more important than having the rifle in his hands is what does he think about the war in his head.''  There are others whose thoughts on this anniversary are different.  Many residents were neither revolutionaries nor people directly associated with the Saigon Government. Among them were men and women with American connections and American friends who in the final moments opted to stay in Vietnam.  ''I sat up all night for the first time in my life,'' a middle-aged man said. ''And I made the decision to remain here. You ask, 'Why did I stay?' I answer with another question: 'Why should I leave?' ''  The man, who said he had worked for American civilians with no connection to Washington or to the Saigon Government, said he understood those who sought to hasten the South's collapse, believing it to be a regime devoid of purpose, lacking in discipline and public morality. He was willing to give the other side a chance.  'I Had Skills They Needed'  But now, he said, he and others like him, while not wanting to leave, have been haunted by their decision to stay because their lives have been difficult and they feel they are no longer making use of their own potential or contributing to the country.  ''They could have used me,'' the man, a writer, said. ''I had skills they needed.''  Instead, he found himself under suspicion. ''They followed me for a long time,'' he said. ''I can do nothing here. But if I returned to the countryside, they would say, 'Why does he do that?' And I would be under suspicion again.''  Unable to find a full-time job, and caught in a worsening economy, the writer and his family jettisoned their treasures: cameras, motor bike, the family refrigerator. The children now make handicrafts ''to pay for their own breakfast,'' he said.  His story was echoed by another Western-trained professional, a doctor, who could have left and could still leave, but chooses to stay because of his attachment to the city. He said he worries about medical standards slipping but has been out of the health-care system since he was briefly detained several years ago after a confrontation with his political superiors.  Saigon, under its new name, remains the apparently prosperous and visibly graceful counterpoint to Hanoi. Here, the shops and cafes are full of goods and people. A fleet of blackmarket stalls survived to provide the privileged with tape recorders, television sets and imported typewriters. Leaving aside private cars, skyscrapers and affluent neighborhoods, which it does not have, Ho Chi Minh City is not too far removed in appearance from some of its non-Communist Southeast Asian neighbors like Bangkok and Jakarta.  The presence of hundreds of foreigners - a Western press corps nearly 200 strong (local papers said 1,000 had applied to come) and invited guests from the antiwar movement in the United States and Europe - has brought crowds to the hotels.  Some residents asked if this foreign influx meant a breakthrough in relations between Vietnam and the United States. Others worried that after the celebrations, a new attempt to curtail the city's freewheeling economic and social style might come.  Little Sense of Festivity  There is little sense of festivity here this weekend, outside the areas set aside for the celebrations. Residents say districts have been assigned quotas to provide the crowds at Tuesday's parade.  There is an official sense of urgency, however. The city center is replete with paint buckets and brooms, and crews are putting the finishing touches on projects all over town.  No Vietcong flags are flying this year, though a few appear on posters. South Vietnam's revolutionaries, who are now described as having ''cooperated'' with the North Vietnamese Army in its final push on Saigon rather than having been the architects of it, were quickly taken under Hanoi's wing after the capture.  A visitor asking about the absence of the Vietcong flag was told they could be seen in the city's museum.

"      For a month the public has been immersed in a flood of retrospection and introspection about the Vietnam War, which ended 10 years ago Tuesday. The outpouring indicates that many people are at least as interested in revising history as understanding it.  It has been a time for recalling battles but also for refighting them verbally as some try to apply the lessons of Vietnam to still unsettled ideological disputes and to current political controversies, notably in Central America.  The conflicting interpretations and re-interpretations of America's last major war may be especially bewildering to those who were born after the start of the United States' direct involvement in Vietnam or those who were very young at the time. Both public opinion sampling by polltakers and empirical evidence indicate that the origins, rationales and purposes of the American experience in Vietnam, and the conduct of American officials and soldiers, are obscure to many people.  But some of the main outlines of what a retired general has called ''the one clear failure'' in American military history are clear.  The war was, of course, a vast human tragedy and contributed directly to nearly immeasurable suffer- The author of this article, who reports on military affairs from the Washington bureau of The Times, was a correspondent in Indochina for five years. ing after it ended. It is clearly significant to recall the postwar genocide in neighboring Cambodia, punitive repression by the victorious Vietnamese Communists and the sad saga of refugees from all three countries - Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos - that once were French Indochina.  But to that accounting it is also useful to add the long effort to forestall failure that cost 58,721 American lives.  The Defense Department says that 183,528 South Vietnamese regular soldiers died and estimates that 925,000 North Vietnamese regular troops and guerrillas were killed. The number of civilian deaths in South Vietnam was put at 415,000 and the civilian deaths in the North were also large, but uncertain.  Defeat cost dearly, but so did the effort to achieve victory. No one can guess what the price would have been to continue, or to resume, the conflict in the mid-1970's.  Forgotten Mileposts Of Vietnam War Among the sometimes forgotten historical mileposts of the war are these:  * The United States originally sought to avoid entanglement in combat through a plan to create a durable South Vietnamese Army and society.  * When increasing North Vietnamese infiltration caused that hope to falter, American troops were sent in force. This was matched by North Vietnamese escalation, in a pattern that would continue throughout the conflict.  * Domestic support for the war eroded as the cost in lives rose.  * ''Vietnamization'' of the war, a gradual turning over of the fighting to the South Vietnamese Army, was substituted for the politically unpalatable course of rapid, outright withdrawal by President Nixon in 1969. During the American withdrawal, South Vietnam achieved apparent progress from 1969 to early 1972, suppressing but never strangling the military challenge to its existence.  * In 1972, the North invaded the South directly, using more artillery than it had ever displayed and large amounts of seldom-seen equipment such as tanks. That ''Easter Offensive'' was beaten back with the aid of very heavy, and effective, United States bombing.  * The ''cease-fire'' negotiated in 1973 was a strategic compromise that left more than 100,000 North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam, and that did not extinguish the North's determination to fight on.  * In the end, South Vietnam was overrun in 1975 in a period of less than two months by a greatly reinforced Northern field army. The United States did not attempt to reverse the rout by re-entering the conflict.  Some of the Footprints Are Now Faint There were, however, many footprints between those milestones, and some have tended to fade with time.  Narrowly defined, direct American participation in the war began in December 1961 in a glow of innocent optimism. The Kennedy Administration faced a slowly growing insurgency in South Vietnam by the Viet Cong, or Vietnamese Communists, supported and prompted by North Vietnam. Many officials traced the movement to China.  An innovative solution was sought and adopted. The United States began not with combat but with what was called ''combat support.'' It furnished combat advisers to even small units of the South Vietnamese Army; provided and flew helicopters to give that army an undreamed-of mobility; expanded the prowess of South Vietnam's air force by placing American pilots in the back seats of fighter planes, and attempted to ''win hearts and minds'' by introducing political, social and economic advisers who at times had a presence in every South Vietnamese province and district.  It began, in short, as a ''proxy war'' and with the deeply held belief, to use the idiom of those first on the ground, that ''our little tigers can beat their little tigers.'' Those involved did not entirely lose their American sense of mocking self-appraisal. The Vietnamese for American adviser was ''Co Van My,'' and one of the scores of parody songs by anonymous young Americans went: Oh, the Russian Revolution Would have never come to pass, If the Co Van My had been there To advise the ruling class. But except in official, public proclamations, the optimism faded. Maladroit efforts by President Ngo Dinh Diem and his family in South Vietnam to smother political dissent by the Buddhist majority - and an ill-concealed intention to purge senior army officers suspected of disloyalty - led to his overthrow and execution by the army in November 1963.  One of the major but most forgotten aspects of the war, which has been the subject of domestic debate in recent years that has intensified in recent months, is that the United States began in an advisory role and by necessity continued in that role in many important ways until the end came in 1975. But for deeply imbedded social and other reasons, South Vietnam stubbornly resisted much of the advice.  The memoirs of all informed American military and civil officials agree that by late 1964 the proxy war was being lost. A major reason was the infiltration of South Vietnam by ever-growing numbers of regular North Vietnamese troops. The initially mild escalation of American effort was being matched by the North Vietnamese, and it would never end.  Johnson Decides To Bomb the North Faced with the clear possibility of defeat, President Johnson reluctantly supplemented combat support of the South with United States soldiers, with the bombing of North Vietnam and with attempts to curb the flow of men and materiel into the South.  Many senior Johnson Administration officials said air power could be made to persuade North Vietnam to cease fighting. Some argued that Ho Chi Minh, the North Vietnamese leader, would choose to protect his industrial base rather than continue the war.  Subsequent Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that even the great weight of bombs dropped, which did very significant damage, never seriously slowed the flow of men and arms southward. But mindful of how the Chinese joined in the Korean War in 1950's, American officials tailored the pressure on North Vietnam to prevent a possible recurrence.  The American troops first sent to South Vietnam, as well as air crews operating from Thailand and ships of the Seventh Fleet in the South China Sea, were well-trained and aggressive. Morale remained high for several years. The combat units were concentrated in the nothern three quarters of South Vietnam, leaving responsibility for the fertile, populous Mekong Delta mostly to the South Vietnamese.  Many American soldiers now believe that a strategy should have been adopted that might have ''isolated the battlefield'' by concentrating men on blocking infiltration routes that air power could not successfully attack. Those soldiers say that if needed, the defense line should have been extended westward into and perhaps across neighboring Laos. The United States chose instead to fight what was called a ''main unit war,'' in which American forces were sent out to find and destroy the North Vietnamese regulars and the elite Vietcong units in sparsely populated parts of the South and to wear them down through attrition.  For this plan to work enemy soldiers had to be killed faster than they could be replaced, and a way had to be found to sap the North Vietnamese will to continue the war. Neither goal was ever attained.  Col. Harry G. Summers Jr. of the Army War College has said that the American execution of battlefield tactics was, in general, excellent and that of the North Vietnamese, who were then fighting at a serious disadvantage in their lack of supporting firepower and little artillery and no air support, was often poor.  But he added that the North had a clear strategy, which it relentlessly pursued, to fight as long as necessary toward a clear goal. It is instructive to recall the somewhat fuzzy war aims of the United States as set forth in 1967 in an ''Official Report on The War In Vietnam'' by the Pacific forces commander, Adm. Ulysses S. G. Sharp, and the Vietnam field commander, Gen. William C. Westmoreland.  Fuzzy Goal Outlined By U.S. Command They wrote that the United States goal was to provide a secure environment in which the South Vietnamese could live and a legal government could function.  But if victory had not quite arrived by 1967, what came to be called ''the victory campaign'' had been started by President Johnson and senior officers and officials in Vietnam. General Westmoreland said he believed the ''crossover point'' had been reached in which enemy troops were falling faster than they could be replaced and that victory in the war was perhaps three years away.  In one of the nearly innumerable, but understandable, contradictions of Vietnam, General Westmoreland also now recalls that he told the President that unless he was reinforced the enemy could probably continue the war indefinitely.  In the meantime, an originally feeble but increasingly powerful antiwar protest movement had developed in the United States. Its dogma was based on some myths about the nature of the conflict and of the Vietnamese factions involved that were at least as flawed as some of the myths of officials prosecuting the war. Press Is Often Blamed For Negative Accounts It has become common to blame pessimistic press accounts of the conduct and progress of the war for an erosion of public support in the United States. But the fervor of the antiwar movement does not appear to have rested on war weariness. To that movement bad news from the battlefield was good news in that the American dissidents yearned not to win the war but to end it.  The North Vietnamese Tet Offensive of early 1968 - the name came from the lunar new year holiday during which the push began - was a great watershed of the war.  From many documents it now seems clear that the Communist forces expected to cause a ''general uprising'' of the Southern population by widespread attacks on cities and a collapse of the South Vietnamese Army and Government, forcing the United States to pull out by this collapse rather than outright defeat.  What happened was that the Communists suffered a serious tactical military defeat, in which much of the indigenous Vietcong guerrillas were killed. In retrospect, though, it is not possible to call it a strategic failure since the enemy persisted and ultimately won.  Tet was a serious shock to American domestic opinion, partly because it called into question the optimistic official appraisals of 1967.  Bombing Is Halted; Talks Are Begun President Johnson withdrew from the 1968 Presidential race, ordered a nearly complete bombing halt of the North and sought to end the war through diplomatic talks. A new cadre of Administration officials abandoned both the goal of victory and of prolonged, indefinite American participation.  After his election, President Nixon chose to begin the withdrawl that critics of the war had sought, but at a pace that infuriated those weary of the war.  In his latest book, Mr. Nixon contends that the United States-South Vietnamese alliance had ''won'' the war by the time a truce was signed in 1973. But the agreement left large North Vietnamese forces in the South and an unenforceable formula for further negotiations aimed at ''solving'' the conflict.  In early 1975, a major North Vietnamese attack in the Central Highlands led to a panicky retreat by South Vietnamese forces there, leaving the South severed.  American Congressional restrictions on the size of logistical support for the South undoubtedly contributed to the surprisingly rapid South Vietnamese defeat.  North Vietnamese troops encircled Saigon closely and in shelling on April 29, 1975, closed the airport to fixed-wing aircraft, also killing two Marines who became the last uniformed Americans to die in the war. On April 29 and 30, helicopters evacuated 1,373 Americans and 5,595 anti-Communist Vietnamese to American ships offshore.  About 50,000 Vietnamese had previously been evacuated by airplane; perhaps three times that number had flown out with privately purchased tickets. About 70,000 Vietnamese escaped in the last days by small boats and ships.  Tanks From North Roll Into Saigon By mid-day on April 30, North Vietnamese tanks entered the South Vietnamese presidential palace grounds, and the long war was over.  In a recent book, Gen. Bruce Palmer Jr. cites the South's inabililty to make quick strategic countermoves as an important element in the defeat. Some of the problem was self-imposed through a sort of residential and regional character of South Vietnamese units, who lived with and were reluctant to leave their families, and some imposed by an unforgiving geography.  There are so many different ''causes'' of the Vietnam defeat that, as recent analysis has shown, it is possible to be highly selective in cataloging them.  Conservatives tend to blame timidity by the press and by Congress for undermining support for a war that might have been won with a more prolonged effort. Others blame inherent weaknesses in the South Vietnamese proxy. Any single thesis can be difficult, at least, to refute.  But General Palmer and some other soldiers cite a factor with which it is hard to quarrel: ''The criticality of the time factor.'' After hard, direct combat from 1965 to 1969, the United States had been unable to finish a bitter and divisive war.  Present-day arguments that the United States ''won'' the conflict did not seem plausible to much of the nation then. Some form of withdrawal seemed unavoidable even to strong adherents of the cause, including the Nixon Administration. Withdrawals seldom end in success.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, April 30   The sun had just risen behind the twin-spired city cathedral today when high-stepping troops and rumbling Soviet tanks began their parade down the Street of April 30 to mark a decade of Communism in what was once known as the Republic of South Vietnam.  The procession started almost exactly at 7:52 A.M., the hour 10 years ago when a helicopter carrying the last American and South Vietnamese evacuees rose from the roof of the United States Embassy when this city was called Saigon.  Today, as jets flew overhead and the ranks of soldiers, sailors, militiawomen, militiamen, factory workers and students passed by, the scene at first suggested a strictly Kremlin-inspired occasion. Nine members of the ruling Politburo, including Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and Le Duan, the Communist Party leader, sat on the reviewing stand among military officers and foreign Communist or fraternal delegations.  But then a local band on the sidelines broke into Vietnamese rock and down the street came roller skaters and a motorcycle club, strutting children and a small sea of women in the brightly colored traditional tunics called ao dais.  ''We don't have this kind of parade in Hanoi,'' a Government official here for the occasion remarked. ''This is South Vietnamese.''  For Ho Chi Minh City, as it is now known,the 10th anniversary of its fall to North Vietnam has also provided an occasion to celebrate itself. Floats bore the industrial and agricultural products of the South as well as reminders of its culture. A few Buddhist monks and Roman Catholic priests sat in the reviewing stand as honored guests.  The anniversary has also given the city the chance to outline the future of its metropolitan area of 3.5 million people, where the spirit of free enterprise, encouraged during the ''American'' years has not been subdued.  Finally, the event has allowed outsiders in this very secretive country glimpses into the security measures taken in the sometimes recalcitrant South, where dozens of people have recently been tried, and several executed, for subversion.   Crowds Large but Quiet  Crowds were large but quiet today around the reviewing stands near the former presidential palace. City officials said the audience included 50,000 ''organized watchers'' brought in by local party committees.  They said they had no reliable estimate of how many others had come on their own. The ranks were swelled by hundreds of street urchins looking for something exciting to watch while doing a little panhandling on the side.  It was difficult to judge reactions. There were no cheers or applause except from the invited guests. A man in the crowd who talked with a Western reporter was hauled off by the police. Contact with foreigners is against the law.  Few Americans accepted Hanoi's invitation to attend the celebrations this week as friends of the country. David Dellinger, one of the Chicago Seven who demonstrated outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention, is here. So is John McAuliff, the head of the Indochina Reconciliation Project, a program of the American Friends Service Committee that campaigns for improved ties between Hanoi and Washington.  Antiwar Activists Absent  Jane Fonda, the actress, Cora Weiss, a peace activist, and the Rev. William Sloane Coffin, pastor of the Riverside Church in Manhattan, who were all prominent antiwar activists, were reported to have turned down invitations.  The more than 150 Western reporters, most of them American, here attract great interest but no apparent hostility from residents. The journalists' reasons for coming baffle some residents. ''Why would you want to come for the anniversary of an occupation?'' an elderly shopowner asked a reporter.  Conversations with Government officials and city residents who were willing to talk indicate that the unfinished business of absorbing the private businesses of Ho Chi Minh City into the Socialist state will dominate local efforts for some time to come.  Mai Chi Tho, who as chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City Peoples Committee functions as the Mayor, said in a news conference Sunday that the local government's main objective was to turn the city from a consumer society spoiled by the false economy of the past to a producer society contributing in very large part to the development of the country. Vietnam is one of the world's poorest nations.  Very Gradual Change  Within that context, he said, family businesses remain important, at least during the transition period, which he said would likely go on until the year 2000. After that, Mr. Tho said collectivization of production, technology and culture, would be completed.  Local shopkeepers say they are under great pressure to turn over their businesses to the state. One shopowner said a new round of takeovers was coming next month and that his family had only a few weeks to decide what to do. Refusing a partnership with Government means unemployment, the shopkeeper said. He said his family would leave the country if it did not have members still in prison camps.  Reporters here heard frequent complaints that it seems economically unsound to continue to squeeze local private enterprise, which has given this city considerably more vitality than Hanoi appears to have. Asked about this concern, a Government official gave the often-heard reply: ''Transforming the South into a Socialist society will always be our first objective.''  ''Socialism cannot work unless everyone participates,'' Mr. Tho said.  Corruption Remains a Problem  Corruption is said to be worse than ever here, a situation related to economic hardship and common even in more prosperous Asian cities. Two Government employees were executed recently for siphoning and reselling Government gasoline. Such sentences do not seem to deter others, residents say.  Educated professionals, denied the right to work or practice because of their middle-class backgrounds and suspected or real connections to the previous regime, talk about having ''right-'' and ''left-'' hand professions, the one they were trained for, and the one they have to engage in to survive in a city where a cup of coffee can cost two days' pay. The relative abundance of consumer goods indicates the money is found somewhere.  Mr. Tho, 62 years old, a brother of Le Duc Tho and a man often mentioned as a candidate for the next generation of leadership, was candid about the city's problems. Ho Chi Minh City, he said, is short of electricity. There is high unemployment coupled with a population growth rate of 2 percent a year, which will mean five million people in the city by the end of the century.  On the other hand, a paper released by Mr. Tho to coincide with the anniversary listed as achievements by the city the promotion of a climate of ''innovative working methods,'' the ''promotion of small industries,'' particularly traditional handicrafts, and a growth in foreign trade. He says the city is a leader in Vietnam in industry, technology, international communications and culture.  Proud of the Police  Mr. Tho, an internal security expert, is also proud of the city's police. He told reporters Sunday, ''Here we have no demonstrations like you do in the West, and no guerrilla groups like they have in the Philippines, Malaysia or Thailand.''  While Vietnamese offficials and Western diplomats in Hanoi say there is no serious resistence movement operating in the South, surveillance here is said to be intense. A resident said he recently saw 16 longhaired plainclothesmen materialize within seconds to seize a man who was shouting on the street. There are occasional Government admissions and trial records that suggest some dissidence does exist.  On Monday when officials took reporters to meet several ''re-education camp'' inmates north of the city, one of the prisoners said he had been arrested in 1982 for joining a ''counterrevolutionary militia.'' He said he had been forced to join by former officers of the South Vietnamese Army.  A former professional now unemployed in Ho Chi Minh City for refusing to accept ''political direction,'' said that something more widespread than open dissent was ''passive noncooperation'' with Government policies.  ''In this cause of national reconciliation'' an army officer at the city's military command said, ''we know many people are happy, but there are others who are not.'' ---- U.S. to Press Efforts on Missing WASHINGTON, April 30 (UPI) - President Reagan promised stepped-up efforts today to press the countries of Southeast Asia to account for all Americans killed in the Vietnam War.  ''The key to resolution of this issue lies in obtaining the full cooperation of the Governments of Vietnam and Laos,'' Mr. Reagan said in a report to Congress on the 2,477 Americans still missing or unaccounted for in Southeast Asia.  While progress has been made in obtaining fuller cooperation from both countries, Mr. Reagan said, the United States ''should not be regarded in any way as satisfied with the current situation or the progress we have made.''  ''Cooperation has been much too slow,'' he said, ''and we must continue to pursue every possible avenue to reach a level which offers maximum potential for results.''  Mr. Reagan said his Administration had ''vigorously pursued'' a full accounting through high-level visits by American officials to Vietnam and Laos, upgraded intelligence efforts, a campaign to focus public attention on missing soldiers and close coordination with the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.  Among the positive diplomatic steps cited by Mr. Reagan were agreements by Vietnam to increase bilateral meetings on the issue to six from four and to consider the missing Americans separately from other matters.  Vietnam turned over the remains of eight Americans in 1984 and six on March 20 of this year, including - for the first time - two men said by the Vietnamese to have died while being held as prisoners of war.

"    It had been more than a decade since Henry A. Kissinger and Le Duc Tho sat together in Paris, negotiating an uneasy settlement to an unpopular war. But the bitterness over the end of the Vietnam War is still close to the surface for Mr. Kissinger, whose temper flared Monday night when the former antagonists appeared on the ABC News program ''Nightline.''  Because of the intensity of the long-distance debate, with Mr. Kissinger in New York and Mr. Tho in Ho Chi Minh City, producers let the program run 11 minutes longer than scheduled to give the former Secretary of State a chance to respond to extensive remarks by the Vietnamese official.  Mr. Kissinger leveled his strongest criticism at the American press, which he criticized for offering - then and now - a sympathetic forum for Vietnamese Communist leaders.  He said that ''probably in retrospect, the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations that first started us into Vietnam bit off more than they could chew,'' and that ''the Nixon Administration, in which I served, could have brought matters to a head - one way or the other - earlier.''  'A Never-Ending Campaign'  But he said the United States ''certainly cannot fight a prolonged war with an inconclusive outcome against an opponent who uses part of the media and many well-meaning people in a never-ending campaign to undermine our psychology.''  Mr. Kissinger, who has a contract with ABC as a consultant, went on, ''I must say that the disproportion in this program between the American point of view and the Vietnamese point of view and the absolutely one-sided account of the correspondents is one of the explanations of how we got to where we are.''  The three major television networks have been broadcasting extensively from Vietnam this week on the 10th anniversary of the Communist takeover of Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City.  Last week on the NBC News program ''Today,'' Bryant Gumbel introduced an interview with Mr. Tho, a senior member of the Vietnamese Communist Party Politburo, by calling him ''the man who outsmarted Henry Kissinger at the Paris peace talks.''  When the ''Nightline'' host, Ted Koppel, speaking from Ho Chi Minh City, asked Mr. Kissinger in New York about the ''remarkable lack of acrimony'' on the part of the Vietnamese toward the United States, Mr. Kissinger said:  ''I think there's something demeaning about having the three networks cover a victory parade over the United States in the city of the country where the victory was achieved. So I don't consider it a great achievement that there's no particular animosity.''  Discussion of Ground Rules  Twice during the program, Mr. Kissinger took the unusual step of discussing the ground rules set up for his appearance, reminding his interviewers that he had said he would not refight the war, but then going on to talk about what he saw as the role of news organizations in hurting the United States Government during the war.  The Vietnamese leaders interviewed appeared pleased to have the opportunity to review what they called their ''total victory.''  Between Mr. Kissinger's two appearances on the program, Mr. Tho gave his version of the Paris peace negotiations and the Communist takeover of Saigon. ''We wrested total victory,'' he concluded, speaking through an interpreter. ''This is a failure of the Vietnamization of the war.''  He offered thanks to the American public ''for their support and contributions to our present victory'' and urge future cooperation between the two countries.  ''We hope American wives and mothers will never again allow their husbands and sons to go to die in another Vietnam War anywhere in the world,'' Mr. Tho said. Interview With Foreign Minister In addition to his live interview with Mr. Tho, which was fraught with technical problems that enabled the Vietnamese leader to talk over Mr. Koppel steadily, Mr. Koppel showed a taped interview with Nguyen Co Thach, Vietnam's Foreign Minister.  Mr. Thach laughingly talked of how the North Vietnamese had easily bested the Central Intelligence Agency in intelligence gathering, and how guerrillas were able ''to fool the B-52 pilots and reconnaissance planes'' by lighting fires deep in the jungles that caused the fliers to drop bombs ''on a vacuum.''  ''They wasted the ammunition of the U.S.,'' he said. ''When the U.S. was here, they have failed. How can they succeed?''  At one point during the program, transmission to Mr. Koppel in Vietnam failed completely and Charles Gibson, a Washington correspondent for ABC, returned to Mr. Kissinger.  ''What we saw,'' Mr. Kissinger said, ''is a defeat which we inflicted upon ourselves.''  Mr. Kissinger said he did not see the point of ''engaging in a debate for two minutes,'' and Mr. Gibson suggested that the program be extended to allow Mr. Kissinger to continue.  'A Certain Cynicism'  When Mr. Gibson commented on Mr. Tho's ''cynicism'' in thanking the American public for its support, Mr. Kissinger said: ''There's also a certain cynicism in correspondents who discuss Thieu in such despicable terms while they are playing up the North Vietnamese victors who violated all of the agreements and led to this situation.'' He was referring to Nguyen Van Thieu, the South Vietnamese President from 1967 to 1975.  ''Le Duc Tho is what he is,'' he continued, citing his ''great courage'' and singlemindedness. But Mr. Tho ''used the American divisions to play on us,'' Mr. Kissinger said, and ''would drop cryptic remarks to correspondents who would then accuse their Government of not seizing the opportunity for peace.''  The North Vietnamese, he said, ''were working on psychology even more than they were working on a military solution.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 1 1985 ,0
"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, May 1   Ten years after the fall of the American-backed Government of South Vietnam, Hanoi's leadership appears divided over how to improve relations with Washington and whether the moment is right to make the effort.  At a news conference today Le Duc Tho, the 74-year-old Politburo member thought to be the most likely successor to the Communist Party Secretary General, Le Duan, took a sharply critical line toward Washington. Criticizing the United States for imposing conditions to the setting up of diplomatic relations and for refusing to allow more cultural and scientific exchanges, Mr. Tho said, ''I can see no possibility of normalization in the immediate future.''  His statements followed comments in an interview last week in Hanoi with Reuters in which Mr. Tho seemed to rule out once and for all the release of prisoners from Vietnamese re-education camps for resettlement in the United States. He said there were 10,000 such prisoners. Government spokesmen here have been giving a figure of 7,000.  On Sunday Le Mai, the 44-year-old Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs who often acts as spokesman for Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, took a more conciliatory line toward Washington in a meeting here with five Western reporters.  'Better Exchange of Views'  ''Contacts between us are more frequent,'' he said. ''We have a better exchange of views and have achieved some kind of mutual understanding.''  Both Mr. Tho and Mr. Mai said the time was right for talks on Cambodia. Mr. Mai said he thought the majority of interested nations now agreed on the outlines of a political solution and that a way had to be found to open discussions on how to bring it about. Both he and Mr. Tho repeated the Vietnamese belief that if there were no talks, the situation would solve itself militarily with no political concessions.  At his news conference today Mr. Tho criticized former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, with whom the Vietnamese leader negotiated the 1973 Paris peace agreement that led to the withdrawal of American troops from South Vietnam. Both men were later jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Mr. Tho said if news reports he had heard were correct, Mr. Kissinger was guilty of ''gross slanders'' about the numbers of political prisoners in Vietnam or the size of casualty figures in the wake of Hanoi's conquest of South Vietnam.  ''Because he smarted under the blow of defeat,'' Mr. Tho said of Mr. Kissinger, ''he is now showing himself as rather aggressive. He is trying to evade the facts.'' [Attempts to reach Mr. Kissinger for reaction, at his home and his office in Washington, were unsuccessful.] Mr. Tho called on the United States to allow more people-to-people exchanges with Vietnam.  ''Over one hundred Americans a year are allowed into Vietnam - military, diplomatic, Congressional, scientific,'' he said. '  From Mr. Mai's perspective exchanges with American delegations have have been fruitful and promising. Mr. Mai, who spent four years on the Vietnamese negotiating team in Paris and has been involved in setting up the Orderly Departure Program, which allows Vietnamese to emigrate legally to the United States, has also been involved in regular discussions on Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War. Meetings on this issue have recently been increased from four to six a year. Last month Hanoi announced that the first joint American-Vietnamese inspection of a wartime crash site would take place in June.  ''There has been quite a lot of progress on M.I.A.'s,'' Mr. Mai said. ''At first our meetings of experts were not very useful but now we are working together better.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 2 1985 ,1
"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, May 2   Somewhere about midway through a week crowded with events to mark the 10th anniversary of the Communist takeover of Saigon, people started noticing the things that were missing.  Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the architect of Vietnam's military defeat of two foreign armies, was not on the reviewing stand at the parade Tuesday, or at any other celebrations in the south. Government officials did not explain why.  Nguyen Thi Binh, the woman who was Foreign Minister of the Provisional Revolutionary Government, the political party of the Vietcong, was due to be present at the opening of a new museum of women's history.  Mrs. Binh did not show up. The museum opening had, in any case, been postponed. There were optimistic responses to requests for interviews with Mrs. Binh, who became familiar to Westerners during the Paris peace talks. But then reporters were told, without elaboration, that Mrs. Binh, now Hanoi's Education Minister, was ''out of the country.'' Explanations were in short supply.  Then there were the missing Russians. After the reception given by Prime Minister Pham Van Dong for invited foreign guests - members of friendship associations in non-Communist countries and fraternal party delegations from the Communist world - Europeans and Americans in attendance reported that if there were any Soviet representatives present they could not be seen among the Cubans and Eastern Europeans.  Many of Vietnam's American friends were absent. Though accounts are conflicting - and there was no official list available - it appears that most of the invited antiwar activists in the United States had sent their regrets. ''Americans have moved on to Nicaragua,'' a European suggested.  On the streets of the city, there were also almost no Amerasian children, the offspring of Vietnamese mothers and American fathers. City officials said they had been sent away so Western visitors would not be annoyed by them.  Some of Ho Chi Minh City's street names were among the missing. An official of the city's press center said that 100 of them had been renamed over the last week to clear away some remaining vestiges of colonialism. On new city maps, there is also a mysterious fading of the ink marking Saigon's famous pagodas and churches, of which there are many in fine condition still used by thousands of Vietnamese.  But the event of the week that may be remembered longest by many journalists for its omissions was a visit to a re-education camp on Monday.  At least 10,000 Vietnamese, whom the Government considers ''war criminals,'' remain in prison camps around the country a decade after the takeover of the south.  Reporters who traveled to the K-4 camp at Xuan Loc, in Long Nai Province, about 50 miles northeast of the city, met two former South Vietnamese Army officers in their early 40's who were being retrained as carpenters. Both Chung Trung Chien and Nguyen Hoang Anh had been rearrested after having served previous sentences. Mr. Chien said he had tried to flee the country. Mr. Anh had joined a ''counterrevolutionary militia'' in 1982.  The prisoners said they were not allowed to describe their living conditions or their daily routines. They had been brought to meet the press near what appeared to be a public park.  Le Nhan, the camp director, said the rules prohibited him from discussing the prisoners' crimes.  He said prisoners could earn from 300 to 2,000 Vietnamese dong a month - $3 to $20 at official exchange rates; or about 90 cents to $6 at black market rates. He said that more than 3,000 former inmates liked the area so much they asked to stay on after release, but that only 100 requests could be granted because of lack of space.  Reporters were never shown the prisoners' quarters, except for a distant glimpse of a dozen or two men playing volleyball and listening to music in a small compound of huts.

"    PENDLETON, Calif., May 5   About 10,000 Southeast Asian refugees gathered at this Marine Corps base Saturday for a reunion including Vietnamese barbecues, photographs of long-lost friends and exhibits of their life when they arrived here a decade ago.  They were among 80,000 Cambodian and Vietnamese immigrants processed here.  Most of the adults at the reunion spoke in their native tongues, while their children, many of them too young to recall the camp, chatted in English.  Crowds of Vietnamese gathered around a massive sculpture called the Hand of Hope. The 8-foot hand, with replicas of a Vietnamese and a Cambodian child cradled in its palm, was covered with freshly cut roses. The work, which was dedicated on July 4, 1975, was built by a Vietnamese artist and two Marines.  ''When we first came, we were very touched by their sensitivity and caring,'' said Loan Bui, who was 8 years old when she and her family arrived in the United States.

"    To the Editor:  ''History and Hindsight: Lessons From Vietnam'' (page A1, April 30) says that by late 1964 the war in Vietnam was being lost and that a ''major reason was the infiltration of South Vietnam by ever-growing numbers of regular North Vietnamese troops.'' It would be nice to believe that the North Vietnamese were the ones to escalate the war and that the war was being won before they did so. The historical record indicates the opposite.  First, according to official U.S. estimates of the time, the number of people coming over the infiltration routes remained fairly steady, 5,400 to 12,400 a year, from 1961 until after the bombing of North Vietnam in 1965. When all the intelligence was in, in fact, it turned out that fewer infiltrators came over the trails in 1964 than in 1962. Second, there is no evidence of infiltration of significant numbers of individual North Vietnamese, much less of regular troops, before December 1964.  All the evidence available at the time was assembled in the State Department white paper ''Aggression From the North: The Record of North Vietnam's Campaign to Conquer South Vietnam,'' which was issued in 1965 to support the case for bombing North Vietnam. No captured documents, equipment or materiel were presented that indicated the presence of North Vietnamese in significant numbers. The white paper was able to present case studies on only four captured infiltrators who were ethnic North Vietnamese.  Neither was evidence presented of the presence of regular North Vietnamese units except the allegations of two of these and of two other captured Vietcong of southern origin.  Later evidence permits two conclusions. First, one battalion of North Vietnamese regulars had entered South Vietnam in December 1964. Second, the United States Government did not know this at the time.  In December 1964 and in January 1965, the first of a new family of Soviet small arms were recovered after clashes with a disciplined and uniformed enemy unit. This aroused suspicion, but it was not until the Highway 19 campaign in February and March of 1965 that there was evidence of the presence of significant numbers of North Vietnamese members of a march unit. Hard evidence then began to accumulate that regular North Vietnamese units had been introduced into South Vietnam. But not until the enemy summer monsoon campaign in the central highlands was it established that the infiltration of North Vietnamese regulars had begun in late 1964 and was substantial.  Thus the war in South Vietnam was being lost before these units arrived, and the U.S. escalated the war before it knew that North Vietnamese regular forces had been introduced.

"    The party is over in Vietnam, where American networks lent their cameras to a self-serving celebration of Hanoi's only real achievement: conquest. Parades make pictures. What got scant attention was the off-camera horror of Vietnam's unrelenting persecution even of former comrades. Some victims risked their lives by talking to The Times's Barbara Crossette and other reporters. Their story is appalling, their fate a major obstacle to any reconciliation with the United States.  One category of victims is pilloried for middle-class origins, Western education or past involvement with Americans. Ten years after Hanoi's conquest of the South, the regime concedes it still holds 10,000 people in ''re-education'' camps, but the actual number is probably 40,000. Reporters admitted to a special visitors' center were blandly told the prisoners clamor to remain in detention. Then why keep these camps off-limits, and off camera?  A second category of victims is accused of ''backwardness,'' insufficent zeal for Hanoi's Prussian brand of Communism. At least 5,000 are held in five work camps. Also jailed or under house arrest are outspoken Buddhists, Catholics and Protestants. Thich Tri Quang, the Buddhist monk who did so much to discredit former Saigon regimes, is an internal exile; so is Quang Do, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee in 1979.  Similarly consigned to jail or limbo are leaders of the South's Communist Party, whose agitations once swayed American hearts and minds. Their star fell with Saigon. Tran Van Ta, once commander of the Viet Cong forces, has not been seen since 1982. Another leader, Nguyen Thi Binh, was among the few scheduled to take part in victory celebrations. She never turned up, the cryptic explanation being that she was ''out of the country.''  All residents of Ho Chi Minh City live under constant surveillance of neighborhood cadres. The penal system cries out for the United Nations investigation requested by the Vietnam Committee for Human Rights, a Paris-based group. What lends urgency to this plea are signs that Hanoi intends to step up its campaign to eliminate remaining traces of Southern heterodoxy.  The only positive gleam caught by the cameras was the desire of Vietnam's leaders to reach out for American respect. They seem unaware that Hanoi has squandered its moral credit by conquests and oppressions that cannot be attributed to colonialism. When those policies change, so will American feelings about reconciliation.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: EDITORIAL                      ",May 10 1985 ,0
"    THE FALL OF SAIGON Scenes From the Sudden End of a Long War. By David Butler. Illustrated. 510 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $17.95.  FOR those of us in Saigon on April 29, 1975, our day began at 4 A.M. with a North Vietnamese artillery and rocket barrage against Tan Son Nhut Airport and ended ignominiously with our flight by helicopter to Navy ships in the South China Sea. In a span of hours, America had lost its first war. When I clambered into a United States Air Force CH-46 helicopter that afternoon, I felt a mixture of relief, exhaustion, fear (not long before, I had seen a South Vietnamese plane shot down by a Communist heat-seeking missile, a bad omen) and anger. The anger was directed at the American Ambassador to South Vietnam, Graham A. Martin, who I believed had betrayed many Vietnamese by stubbornly delaying their evacuation while he vainly hoped to avoid defeat.  A decade has now passed, a ''decent interval,'' in Henry Kissinger's phrase, for reaching judgment about why South Vietnam collapsed and how Americans handled their defeat. David Butler was another witness who couldn't forget, and he has offered his own account in ''The Fall of Saigon: Scenes From the Sudden End of a Long War.'' Mr. Butler left his job as an editor of Playboy and moved to Saigon in 1974, well after the glory days for journalists, where he worked as a stringer for NBC radio. In ''The Fall of Saigon,'' he has written a detailed and at times poignant journalistic re-creation of those terrible last 55 days, beginning with the North Vietnamese attack on Ban Me Thuot in the Central Highlands that unleashed the debacle.  Imitating the format employed so successfully in ''Is Paris Burning?'' by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, Mr. Butler presents some extraordinary vignettes from what he aptly describes as the Fellini-like atmosphere of that sad country. There is Gen. Homer Smith, the head of the United States Defense Attache's office, driving over to see Gen. Cao Van Vien, the chairman of the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff, after the Communist seizure of Ban Me Thuot in early March, the worst loss since the Tet offensive of 1968. General Smith inquired about the effect of the battle, but General Vien did not even mention that President Nguyen Van Thieu had secretly ordered his forces to abandon the entire Central Highlands. It was the most momentous and miscalculated decision of the entire war. The Highlands commander, Gen. Phan Van Phu, didn't tell his own troops either. He just flew out, setting off the panic that would spread like a contagion and cause cities to collapse before the Communists even attacked.  Then there is Capt. Do Duc Cuong, a decent, even heroic South Vietnamese intelligence officer whose family had been killed by the Vietcong when he was a boy. His commanding officers kept deserting their troops, at Hue, Danang and finally near Saigon, but Captain Cuong kept trying to find someone to report to, to rally any soldiers he came across. In the end, disgusted by the loss of Hue without a fight, he said, ''Our generals gave it to the dogs and the chickens.''  Or there is Big Minh, Gen. Duong Van Minh, the supposedly neutralist leader who was made South Vietnam's President two days before the end in hopes of arranging a negotiated settlement. When on the morning of April 29, with North Vietnamese troops in Saigon's outskirts, the French Ambassador encouraged him to declare a unilateral cease-fire, the French-trained General Minh replied: ''No. . . . I am a French general. Your military code does not permit me to surrender under these conditions.''  There is also the final act, the last 11 marines left on the roof of the American Embassy. For some reason it took almost two hours to send one last helicopter to rescue them as dawn broke on the morning of April 30, and they grew apprehensive that they had been abandoned. As so many Vietnamese were. Vietnamese on the street were sniping at them, and when other Vietnamese tried to reach through a door to the roof, the marines grabbed their arms and jammed them against the broken glass. When a helicopter finally arrived, the marines tossed tear gas grenades over the edge of the building. They forgot that a chopper's blades suck up air. ''So the last official Americans out of Vietnam,'' Mr. Butler writes, ''all flew blind out of Saigon.''  But despite these marvelous anecdotes, there is something missing in ''The Fall of Saigon.'' As the book's subtitle suggests, Mr. Butler contents himself with mere snapshots and falls short of any real analysis. Too many of the vignettes are trivial; for example, Mr. Butler seems infatuated with a Vietnamese rock band called The Uptight. The book also suffers from a certain lack of originality. Much of the most important part - the dramatic cable traffic between Ambassador Martin and Secretary of State Kissinger, for instance, and the squabbling within the American mission over the evacuation - was recounted by Frank Snepp, the former Central Intelligence Agency officer in Saigon, in ''Decent Interval,'' published in 1977. A little-publicized 1983 book by Arnold R. Isaacs, ''Without Honor,'' offered a more thoughtful and coherent account of the end of the Vietnam War.  In retrospect, there are no big mysteries about who lost Vietnam. Everyone had a hand in it. Mr. Kissinger, for one. After the Paris Peace Accords of 1973, for which he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, the United States had no real policy toward Vietnam, only the pretense of one, based on a paradox. We had withdrawn our armed forces from Vietnam, and the public had lost any interest in Vietnam's future, but officially we were still committed to preserving South Vietnam. It was an untenable situation, and Hanoi saw through it.  Congress deserves its share of the blame too. In cutting military aid to Vietnam from $2.5 billion in fiscal 1973 to a projected $700 million in 1975, it reduced Saigon's forces to only 2 percent of the funds and supplies American soldiers had got in 1968. The cuts bred defeatism among South Vietnamese.  The largest slice of responsibility rests with the South Vietnamese themselves. It was their system's inherent weaknesses - poor leadership, corruption, the lack of any unifying goal beyond the Confucian ideal of the family - that were suddenly exposed after President Thieu ordered the Highlands abandoned. S TILL, given the rout - which, Mr. Butler shows, the C.I.A. station chief recognized from the beginning - there remains a troublesome question. Why did Ambassador Martin so vigorously oppose efforts to evacuate Vietnamese whose ties to the Americans put them at risk? He has always claimed he wanted to prevent the panic that would have been caused by starting the pullout too soon. But even as late as the afternoon of April 29, with the helicopters already in action, the embassy deliberately failed to notify Vietnamese employees that there were two huge barges waiting on the Saigon River capable of taking out 16,000 people. In the end the barges left half-empty, filled only with people who found them by accident. The embassy's planning for the evacuation was so slipshod that when I walked to the apartment building where newsmen had been instructed to gather discreetly, the doors were locked. We had to wait outside in the street, attracting a crowd of Vietnamese, some of whom crammed into a convoy of American military buses with us when they finally arrived. Our driver proceeded to get lost in Saigon's streets.  In the aftermath, the Communists were almost as stunned by their victory as the South Vietnamese were by their defeat. David Butler quotes a North Vietnamese soldier as asking a Saigon resident, ''How could an army from a city like this not fight for it?'' Another North Vietnamese soldier remarked: ''Why did you let us win? It will be terrible now. We can never understand a society like this.''

"   , N.J.   Soon after the end of the First World War, Gen. Erich von Ludendorff and some reactionary nationalist leaders invented a myth to explain Germany's defeat. The German Army, thoroughly beaten in the field after the failure of the March 1918 offensive, had, they asserted, really won the war. But then, like Siegfried in the heroic German sagas, it had been ''stabbed in the back'' by the politicians.  Today, a similar myth is being fabricated to explain our fiasco in Vietnam. For example, Richard M. Nixon has written in his most recent book: ''When we signed the Paris peace agreements in 1973, we had won the war . . . Defeat came only when the Congress . . . refused to provide military aid to Saigon.'' In other words, Mr. Nixon implies, Congress had stabbed his Administration - and the American people - in the back. That myth has been endorsed, though somewhat less categorically, by both Henry A. Kissinger and The Wall Street Journal and is being repeated as an article of faith by the American right wing.  The facts, however, tell a different story.  By the end of 1968, most of the top echelon of the Johnson Administration had concluded that the Vietnam War was unwinnable. When Lyndon B. Johnson declined to run for a new term, he left the problem of extrication to his successor.  Unlike Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nixon had no responsibility for our Vietnamese imbroglio, and he could have made a tactical settlement without confessing error. America then had in Vietnam a vast army of more than a half-million men and, to exploit that moment of ultimate bargaining power, Mr. Nixon could have offered the North Vietnamese a Hobson's choice.  If they were prepared to make an overall settlement, we would agree to withdraw our forces unilaterally; if they rejected that offer, we would pursue the war with even greater intensity. To be sure, there was no way we could have hoped to achieve our full objective, but we could almost certainly have made a better bargain than we made four years later - and saved thousands of human lives.  But, overvaluing the efficacy of air power against a primitive economy, Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger remained bemused by the thought that by dealing ''brutal blows,'' our bombers could force Hanoi to the breaking point. Thus, it was not until 20 months after Mr. Nixon became President that Mr. Kissinger even tentatively played the one bargaining card that had any meaning to Hanoi - the hint of an offer to withdraw American troops unilaterally. But that was too late; by then Mr. Nixon had destroyed our bargaining leverage by announcing major troop withdrawals and indicating that he planned a phased withdrawal of all American forces. All Hanoi had to do was to stall negotiations until the American Army had gone home, then sign an agreement that would assure their victory over the South Vietnamese. So they signed nothing while continuing to fight, until America had withdrawn all but a meager remnant of 23,000 men who were themselves shortly scheduled to leave.  At that point, the North Vietnamese had effectively won - and they knew it. After some months of replenishing their supplies and regrouping their forces, they rolled up the South Vietnamese Army and captured Saigon while the world watched television pictures of desperate South Vietnamese hanging to the undercarriages of the helicopters that were evacuating our countrymen. Such is the lamentable story of America's defeat. Rather than using our bargaining power to end the war when we still had a vast army in the field, we deployed heavy bombers to spread indiscriminate carnage while we brought home our troops. And once our forces had left Vietnam, defeat was effectively assured. So there was no stab in the back. The public was sick of the war, and Congress wisely registered that repulsion by recognizing reality and halting the killing and further profligate waste of resources.  No one but our soldiers, sailors and airmen who did the actual fighting emerged free from blame. The Eisenhower Administration promised limited aid to the Saigon Government; the Kennedy Administration provided military equipment and greatly increased the number of military advisors; the Johnson Administration turned our limited commitment into an all-out engagement; and the Nixon Administration kept America in the war a further four years at a cost in lives of 20,000 young Americans and several hundred thousand Vietnamese.  No doubt future historians will reject current efforts to invent a Vietnam betrayal legend, just as they have totally discredited General Ludendorff's myth. But even though self-serving revisions of history have only a short life span, they can still do harm. The Ludendorff myth not only helped poison public life in the Weimar Republic but also gave Hitler a strong assist in his rise to power.  Vietnam has already provided enough turbulence and outrage; we can do without a divisive mythology that can only create further resentment.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   A decade ago she was a multilingual lawyer qualified to practice on three continents. Now she sells embroidered blouses to Soviet-bloc tourists in a souvenir shop.  He was a skilled interpreter. Today he works as a part-time waiter and private teacher of French and English. He worries both about the hunger and the ''militarization'' of his children.  She was the daughter of a doctor. Forbidden to continue with higher education because of her middle-class background, she now fills her time as a bookkeeper for a relative's small business.  They were laborers, the two quiet men living side by side in small wooden houses on a muddy dead-end street. They now spend empty days sitting on straight-back chairs, staring out of windows, waiting for permission to leave the country. One wears stained and faded prison pajamas. He was recently freed after 9 1/2 years in a ''re-education'' camp.  These and some other residents of Ho Chi Minh City took the risk of speaking to Western reporters during the 10th anniversary celebrations of the fall of this city, the former Saigon, in the Vietnam War on April 30. They said they did so with a sense of urgency and sometimes forboding.  Vietnamese leaders have said they intend to ''consolidate socialism'' in the south by the end of the century. Fearful southerners think that means the next decade under Hanoi's rule will be marked by severe new measures to remove the anomalies of private property and free enterprise, and new waves of arrests to eliminate those who are ideologically suspect.  Southern Vietnamese also fear -more from instinct than from evidence - that the door to both legal and illegal emigration could be closed, and that the limited access to the West could be further curtailed.  The blouse seller ended her tale of present problems and future fears with the commonly heard comment, ''I don't know what to do.''  Hanoi has been taking a tougher public stance against Vietnamese emigres who become outspoken critics abroad. There is also some evidence the Government is concerned about independent criticism at home, especially from apparently disullusioned members of what was called the third force. They were critics of the Government of South Vietnam, and some had been imprisoned or harassed by the Saigon regime.  Earl Martin, an American who directed aid programs for the Mennonite Church in South Vietnam before 1975 and had written somewhat sympathetically about the Marxist revolutionaries, was asked to leave Ho Chi Minh City this week half way through a two-week visa. At the airport he was searched and interrogated for indications that he had met any former third force acquaintances.  Even now, in the midst of political and economic adversity, it is almost impossible to find anyone in the south with a kind word for former President Nguyen Van Thieu, leader of South Vietnam from 1967 to 1975.  But there are supporters, including former officials, of the last South Vietnamese Government who have successfully made the transition to a new political system. Among them is Gen. Nguyen Huu Hanh, the operations officer who ordered Saigon's troops to lay down their arms in 1975.  Now 61 years old, he lives in comfortable retirement in a relatively large house. His wife runs a cafe in the front garden. Reporters are regularly taken to meet General Hanh, who stresses to visitors how important it is that Vietnam is finally the master of its own fate, free of civil war.  General Hanh acknowledges that he has misgivings about the ''re-education'' camps and other forms of detention without trial. But he says he has been assured by Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach that war-crimes tribunals would be worse, since many of those found guilty in such trials would no doubt be executed.

"    A VIETCONG MEMOIR By Truong Nhu Tang. With David Chanoff and Doan Van Toai. Illustrated. 350 pp. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $17.95.  THE torrent of books about the Vietnam War brings to mind King Richard II's woeful invitation, ''Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings.'' If there are any but sad stories about those 30 years of strife between Westerners and Asians, they are yet to be told. The literature is a litany of death - deaths of men, women and children; of governments and reputations; of ideals and morals; of buddies and innocents, heroes and poltroons. ''A Vietcong Memoir'' by Truong Nhu Tang is about the death of a dream, a dream of an independent, peaceful and democratic Vietnam.  Mr. Tang is a dedicated nationalist who was never a Communist but was willing to work with the Communists to achieve national independence - the kind of Vietnamese the French and Americans never sufficiently understood and whom the Communists understood all too well. His dream appeared in 1945 when, as one of six sons of an affluent Saigon family, he went to study in Paris and met Ho Chi Minh. He was captivated by Ho's ''simplicity, his charm, his familiarity'' and his ''burning patriotism.'' He finally broke with his family to join the Communist underground.  At first he led a double life in Saigon, working as an ostensibly proper bank official while proselytizing ''for the revolution.'' Exposed by a cell member who confessed under torture by the Saigon regime, Mr. Tang survived several months in prison, then went into the jungle - not as a combatant but as a politician - to help form the National Liberation Front and later the Provisional Revolutionary Government that was supposed to govern South Vietnam when the Americans were driven out and their imposed government collapsed. That the Provisional Government would someday prevail, Mr. Tang seems not to have doubted, even though all its orders came from the Communists in Hanoi. It was the North, in fact, that shaped the Government's ''14 points'' with their promise of democracy and a reconciliation of all Vietnamese, whatever their earlier loyalties, once independence was achieved.  Mr. Tang worked for the cause and watched with admiration as the Communist strategy, danh va dam (fighting and talking), gradually eviscerated a succession of South Vietnamese governments and nullified the overwhelming military might of the United States. His version of what happened between the mid-1960's, when America made Vietnam its war, and the mid-1970's, when the Communists took over South Vietnam, makes this one of the most interesting of the books now issuing from the other side of the struggle. It is literate, mercifully free of the stridencies and banalities that characterize the Communists' agitprop prose; this may be Mr. Tang's own doing, or it may be the work of his two collaborators, who share the copyright of the book but curiously are not identified by the publisher except by name (Mr. Chanoff, in fact, is an assistant professor of political science at Harvard University; Mr. Toai, who has written about being in prison, under both the Saigon and Hanoi regimes, is at the University of California's Institute of East Asian Studies at Berkeley). At any rate, the prose is readable and gives off an aura of authenticity and reasonableness.  For example, Mr. Tang sees in the American and South Vietnamese Governments' refusal to entertain the notion of a coalition the reasons for the death of his and the other non-Communist nationalists' dream. ''With hindsight,'' he says, ''one can speculate on the survival potential of a coalition government, one faction backed by Hanoi, one by the United States, while 'third force' neutralists were wooed by both. China, it was clear even then, would have found practical ways to support such a regime, and it is not too imaginative to believe that many Third World and Western nations would have done the same.'' But the sparse history of coalition with Communists suggests a questionable trust in hope over experience.  The author's beloved Provisional Revolutionary Government came to power, if it can be called that, very briefly in 1975, ''riding on the back of the North Vietnamese Army's tiger; precarious and tentative guests in our own house.'' The prospect of a separate South Vietnamese republic governed by Southerners melted as quickly as a Mekong Delta mist before the sun. Communist cadres from the North quickly elbowed aside most of the non-Communists in the Provisional Government. Mr. Tang, one of the few who was not, was made Minister of Justice, but he knew by then it was all a charade.  Fourteen years after he helped launch the ''revolution'' in the jungles, Minister of Justice Truong Nhu Tang returned home to find his father had died, his mother terrified by what was happening, his brothers imprisoned or in jeopardy. His second wife had divorced him and fled to America; his son and daughter had also fled the country. O N May 15, 1975, he stood on the reviewing stand for Saigon's tumultuous independence parade, waiting impatiently for the South's veterans, the Vietcong soldiers, to appear. They finally came, unkempt and ragtag, trailing after newly uniformed soldiers of the North Vietnamese Army in colonial-style pith helmets, and the only flag they carried was red with the single yellow star of the North. The North Vietnamese functionary standing next to Mr. Tang said, ''The Army has already been unified.'' Now not even the charade remained. Instead of the program of ''reconciliation'' that had been a central promise of the Provisional Government and its Northern mentors, Southerners who had ever associated with the South Vietnamese army or any of its succession of regimes, with the Americans or wartime business interests, were rounded up and sent to ''re-education camps.'' Some were told to bring clothing and food for 10 days, some for 30 days. More than 300,000 were swept away in the first year. Days, weeks, months, years passed before many returned. According to Mr. Tang and to other sources, many still have not.  By 1977, Mr. Tang saw no glimmer in the few tatters that were left of his dream. ''They were the conquerors,'' he said of the North, ''and we were the vanquished.'' After a year of preparation, he and a large band of Saigonese jammed into a small river boat, made their way to sea, survived an attack by pirates and reached exile. Today he lives in Paris, where 40 years ago he first discovered the seeds of independence. He now wonders whether, after they had been ''injected into the founding of a new nation'' by revolutionaries like himself, these seeds ''will yet bear fruit.'' He doubtless will not live long enough to know.

"   , Thailand, June 8   Vietnam's official radio said today that United States hostility ''would only do harm to efforts seeking Americans missing in action'' in the Vietnam War.  The Hanoi radio broadcast said allegations that Vietnam had tortured American captives and forced them to work in labor camps were groundless.  The United States authorities say 2,441 servicemen and 42 civilians are listed as missing in Indochina. Hanoi has repeatedly said that it holds no more American prisoners of war.  President Reagan said Thursday that Vietnam must give the ''fullest possible accounting'' of American missing in action before normalization of United States-Vietnamese relations can be considered.

"    As a young man he wrote love poems. His friends used to borrow them to impress their sweethearts.  But later he fell into what he calls a ''swampland'' of prisons and re-education camps in Vietnam. And as other prisoners might practice yoga to survive, or scratch off the years on filthy walls, Nguyen Chi Thien practiced poetry and scratched his verses in his mind.  According to Amnesty International, International PEN and other rights groups and intellectuals who have taken an interest in his case, the 52-year-old poet, who has spent 23 years in jails and re-education camps since 1958, now lives in old Hoa Lo Prison in Hanoi, the place once known to captured American airmen as the Hanoi Hilton.  Nearly 400 of Mr. Thien's poems, gathered in one volume titled ''Flowers From Hell,'' were brought out of Vietnam in 1979 in manuscript form. The poems, translated into French and English, have since been published in the West; some have been put to music.  Ha Huyen Chi, a Vietnamese poet now living in Washington State, says he believes that Mr. Thien may rank among the leading Vietnamese poets of the century.  Harsh Words About Marx  A typical quatrain, translated by an editor at Yale University named Huynh Sanh Thong, describes the poems themselves:  Flowers from hell - real blood has watered them, blood mixed with animal sweat, with parting tears.  Blooming in prison, sickly, starved and cold, they reek of damp and mold, look gray as mud.  Mr. Thien, a longtime opponent of the Communist Government in Vietnam, is said to have become totally opposed to Communism while being ''re-educated.'' In several poems he assails Marx and Ho Chi Minh - who is regarded in Vietnam as the father of the country - and cries out against what he sees as the hypocrisy of the Government. He shouts against suffering and almost urges revolt.  Six years ago, Mr. Thien managed to get inside the British Embassy in Hanoi with a sheaf of poems like this one, also translated by Mr. Thong:  My poetry's not mere poetry, no, but it's the sound of sobbing from a life, the din of doors in a dark jail, the wheeze of two poor wasted lungs, the thud of earth tossed down to bury dreams, the clank of hoes that dig up memories, the clash of teeth all chattering from cold, the cry of hunger from a stomach wrenching wild, the throb-throb of a heart that grieves, forlorn, the helpless voice before so many wrecks.  All sounds of life half lived, of death half died - no poetry, no.  A Memory for Verse  Tran Nhu, a friend and former fellow prisoner of Mr. Thien, said from his home in Kansas that Mr. Thien was born in Hanoi in June 1933, the youngest of five children. Mr. Thien's father had been an engineer for the French before the victory of the Vietminh in 1954. The family thought of moving south. They got only as far as the port city of Haiphong.  Mr. Thien's friends knew him in the 1940's and 50's as bright, witty, shy with girls and loyal to his friends. He had, they said, an extraordinary memory for verse.  In 1958 Mr. Thien and other young writers in Haiphong decided to start a literary magazine. North Vietmam's leaders had recently inaugurated a Chinese-style ''100 flowers'' campaign and more free expression than usual was in the air. One day Mr. Thien approached Haiphong's cultural officials and asked permission to publish a journal that would be called Vi Dan, or ''For the People.''  But the party's mood had quietly shifted since the campaign had begun. He was told to go home and await a decision. The next day, the police arrived, searched his house and seized his romantic poems. They were used as evidence that Mr. Thien and his friends nurtured ideas that discredited Communism.  He was sentenced to two years' hard labor in Yen Bay Province, north of Hanoi. His camp there - and the camps that followed in the wilder regions of northern Vietnam - became the hell of Mr. Thien's poems.  An 'Underdeveloped Citizen'  Released in early 1961, he joined an amateurish anti-Government group known as Doan Ket, or Union and Solidarity, according to Mr. Nhu, who was also a member. That November, Amnesty reports, Mr. Thien was declared an ''underdeveloped citizen.'' He was sent to re-education camp, released again in September 1964, and sentenced again the following month. He lived in ''the swampland'' for the next 13 years.  On April 2, 1979, during a brief period of freedom, he made a desperate attempt to find a wider audience for his poems. He was living in Haiphong. Having made his mind to send his poems abroad, he went to the British Embassy in Hanoi and handed copies of them to a British diplomat. An accompanying letter, in French, asked ''on behalf of the millions of innocent victims of dictatorship, already fallen or dying a slow and painful death in Communist prisons'' that the poems be published.  The Vietnamese guards arrested Mr. Thien immediately and he has been in prison ever since.  The British diplomat later gave the manuscript of ''Flowers From Hell'' to Patrick J. Honey, a scholar of Vietnamese at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies. Mr. Honey read the poems and decided that although a few seemed coarsely anti-Communist, others were superb and, for Vietnamese verse, unprecedented in their passion.  Photocopies of the poems began circulating in Europe and the United States. They were eventually printed in Vietnamese, and a Vietnamese folksinger in California, Pham Duy, set 20 to music. Two years ago Huynh Sanh Thong at Yale printed ''Flowers From Hell'' with his English translations.  Pierre Emmanuel, a member of the French Academy, and other prominent literary figures have lavished praise on Mr. Thien's verses. Leopold S. Senghor, the former President of Senegal who is also a member of the Academy and a distinguished poet, wrote to Vietnam's Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong, last November asking that Mr. Thien be granted amnesty.  Mr. Senghor has not yet received an answer, according to PEN officials. But several weeks after Mr. Senghor's letter went out, Mr. Thien was reportedly transferred from a jailhouse in Haiphong to Hanoi's Hoa Lo Prison.

"    Xuan Thuy, vice chairman of Vietnam's National Assembly and North Vietnam's chief diplomat at the Paris peace talks that led to the withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, died Tuesday in Hanoi, according to a report on Radio Hanoi Wednesday. He was 73 years old.  Although Mr. Thuy has acted as an international spokesman for Vietnam for nearly four decades since its Communist leadership emerged in the 1950's, his most prominent public position was as North Vietnam's chief representative at the Paris peace talks.  For more than four years until the cease-fire agreement was signed Jan. 27, 1973, the slight, smiling man with the cherubic face headed the North Vietnamese negotiating team. Other negotiators described him as articulate, informed, generally affable and a consumate diplomat. He also served as Hanoi's chief deputy in secret negotiations between Henry A. Kissinger and Le Duc Tho, the North Vietnamese Politburo member.  Mr. Thuy was born in 1912 in the Ha Dong province of North Vietnam and educated at a French high school in Hanoi. He became involved in nationalist politics while still in his early teens.  Fought French Rule as Teen-Ager  In 1926, when he was 14 years old, he joined Ho Chi Minh's Revolutionary Youth League. He was arrested by the French for political agitation twice during the 1920's, the first time when he was 16. When he was 18 he was sent to the penal colony on Con Son Island, then known as Poulo Condore, in the South China Sea.  He joined the Indochina Communist Party in 1938. In 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, he was imprisoned at Sonla in northern Vietnam, and was held there for six years during the Japanese occupation. In prison he edited a clandestine Communist newspaper, Suoi Reo.  Mr. Thuy was released from prison in 1945 at the same time as the Viet Minh, the coalition of Communist and nationalist groups that opposed both the French and the Japanese during the war, was taking power from the Japanese occupation forces. He became editor and director of Cuu Quoc, the official newspaper of the Viet Minh.  In 1946 he was elected to the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which the Viet Minh established to resist French rule.  Traveled Abroad in 1950's  Mr. Thuy was sent abroad in 1950, during the war for independence from the French, and in the following years he traveled extensively, visiting Vienna, Stockholm, and Rangoon, Burma, as well as Peking and Moscow. He spoke French and Chinese fluently.  In 1961 and 1962, Mr. Thuy was deputy chairman of the North Vietnamese delegation to the Geneva Conference on Laos. There, facing W. Averell Harriman across the bargaining table, he was described as ''a top-drawer negotiator, a dreadful fellow to face across the table day after day,'' according to an American negotator.  On returning to Hanoi from Geneva, he became Foreign Minister in 1963, but stepped down, ostensibly ''health reasons'' in 1965 after losing a political struggle within the country's leadership when he supported a pro-Moscow line. His replacement, Nguyen Duy Trinh, was regarded as a hard-liner who leaned toward Peking in the Chinese-Soviet ideological struggle.  Mr. Thuy seemed to fall out of favor in Hanoi for several years until returning as a negotiator in the Paris peace talks that began in 1968.  Mr. Thuy was said to have married and had children, but it was not known how many or if they were still alive.

"    THE TUNNELS OF CU CHI By Tom Mangold and John Penycate. Illustrated. 294 pp. New York: Random House. $19.95.  THE words ''Cu Chi,'' even in this 10th-anniversary year of Vietnam, fall like leaden lumps on American ears, alien words, no connotations, hardly even dim familiarity. Not so in Vietnam. Today in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Cu Chi sets off an electric spark the way, say, Guadalcanal does to American ears. In Vietnam, Cu Chi has become a metaphor of success in the long struggle against the United States.  There is an irony about this. Again and again in the later years of President Lyndon Johnson's term he would send Robert McNamara or McGeorge Bundy or Gen. Maxwell Taylor out to Saigon or call Gen. William Westmoreland back to Washington. There would be talk of ''light at the end of the tunnel.'' It became a cliche.  Ironically, what these men knew about the great underground tunnel complex illuminated in ''The Tunnels of Cu Chi'' by the English reporters Tom Mangold and John Penycate, is by no means clear. Nor does it seem likely that they had much understanding of the remarkable tunnel war techniques elaborated by the Vietnamese guerrillas as a way of balancing off America's overwhelming technological and logistic superiority.  What went on in the tunnels of Cu Chi was deadly man-to-man combat just below the level of the ground, a renaissance of tactics and devices as ancient as those used by the Greeks, Babylonians and early Chinese, as primitive as those of the cave man, fearsome to defender and attacker alike. This was combat at the level of savages - tooth-and-claw, knife-and-club.  The story of the tunnels of Cu Chi is an exemplary piece of investigative reporting and current history. The authors have spent much time on the spot inspecting remaining tunnels and talking with men and women who fought and worked in them, commanders and political chiefs, tunnel surgeons, women who gave birth to babies in these gloomy depths, nurses, entertainers, workers in tunnel factories. They have talked with every American tunnel fighter they could find, inter-viewed American field commanders who learned the nature of tunnel warfare on the job, combed intelligence files, interrogation reports, captured documents.  There is a certain repetition about the American experience. Again and again, American fighting forces -notably the 25th ''Tropic Lightning'' Division and ''Big Red One,'' the First Infantry Division - took up base areas only to find themselves camping on top of a human fire-ant nest - Vietnamese tunnel forces. The tunnels, as the Americans slowly discovered, extended into Saigon itself and snaked for dozens of miles across the countryside, so that Vietnamese regulars from the north could move almost entirely by tunnel from their Cambodian sanctuaries to the Saigon suburbs and back.  Much planning and direction of the Tet offensive of 1968 was done in the tunnels of Cu Chi, just north of Saigon, and those of the Iron Triangle, a bit north of that. Sometimes the tunnels came in three levels - the first a scant five feet below the surface, the last possibly 15 or 18 feet down, never too deep because of lack of power and machinery for ventilation. Some tunnels broadened into caverns for command, logistical or hospital purposes. But for the most part, they were snakelike crawl tunnels, often too small for American G.I.'s. They were seldom as much as three or four feet high, twisting, turning, booby-trapped to a fare-thee-well.  Nothing more fetid could be imagined. Penetrating the Cu Chi tunnels was like traversing the pit below a latrine. There were water baffles, like those of a flush toilet (to prevent the spread of chemical gases). Filled with human detritus, the baffle had to be passed by the tunnel rat. Tunnels were back-angled with V-twists, trapdoors (tension-balanced to hand grenades) often stacked with decaying bodies (the Vietnamese tried to recover all wounded and dead to confuse American body counts). Scorpions and poisonous insects infested the walls.  Air in these chambers was often too foul to breathe. The Americans tried to pump the tunnels full of chemical irritants, but the gases sometimes proved fatal in the close confines. Dynamite blasted the tunnels and bulldozers plowed them up. Casualties on both sides were heavy. But again and again, a few Vietnamese with tin bowls and pans gouged out new tunnels.  After Tet, the Americans assaulted Cu Chi and the Iron Triangle with plows and defoliants. They planted the desert with quick-burning grasses and burned and reburned it to expose any trace of new tunnel digging. That ended the Cu Chi tunnels, but not far away new ones appeared. Yet they never regained their old vigor. Vietnamese casualties had been too heavy at Tet. T HE Americans who fought in the tunnels were just as brave and in the end as skillful as the Vietnamese. The real shock of ''The Tunnels of Cu Chi'' is the years it took the American command to understand why they never could locate the ''light'' at the end of the tunnel. No one had told them there would be a tunnel war. They had not informed themselves of the fact that Vietnamese tunnels had ringed Dien Bien Phu when the French garrison fell in 1954. Not many Americans - military or civil - bothered to study the French experience. They had lost the war. When we put our weight on Vietnam, we believed it would crumble. Nothing, it was thought, could stand up to our firepower of carrier-based planes, the B-52's, the helicopter gunships, all the rest. Nothing on earth could resist the United States of America.  Nothing on earth. There was the rub. The Vietnamese guerrillas went under the earth, hung tough in obscene conditions and lived to see the helicopters lift off the last Americans from the embassy in Saigon.  ''The Tunnels of Cu Chi'' is a chilling and cautionary tale - not a revisionist view of Vietnamese history, but another textbook to teach us what the war really was and how it was fought.

"   , Indonesia, June 29   The United States and Vietnam appear willing to consider opening an American technical office in Hanoi to hasten the process of accounting for American servicemen missing since the Vietnam War, according to statements from both countries.  The Reagan Administration, in a statement issued by the United States Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, made it clear that such a move would depend on a ''significantly'' higher level of Vietnamese cooperation in the search for missing Americans.  The proposal has been discussed with both Hanoi and Washington by Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, who has been serving as go-between with Vietnam for the non-Communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations in its efforts to resolve the problem of Cambodia.  In an interview Friday, Mr. Mochtar said that although Washington was reluctant to establish any presence in Hanoi that might be misconstrued as the beginning of diplomatic recognition, the idea of a technical office was ''very much'' alive.  No Need Seen Now  The American statement issued in Bangkok said there appeared to be no necessity at this time for a technical office. But it added:  ''Were circumstances to change, and Vietnam's cooperation to increase significantly in such a way as to require the more frequent or even continuous deployment of technical personnel, we would give it serious consideration. This would, of course, have no relation to the issue of diplomatic relations.''  Tran Ngoc Thach, a spokesman for the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, confirmed that the idea was under consideration but said it had not been directly discussed between the two countries.  The United States, which has no official presence in Hanoi, says progress on the issue of the missing Americans, along with the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, are prerequisites to better relations. A decade after the end of the Vietnam War, more than 2,400 Americans are still listed as missing in Indochina, 1,375 of them in Vietnam.  The opening of an American technical office in Hanoi, which Mr. Mochtar said the Vietnamese are actively seeking, would establish the first permanent American presence in the country in a decade.  No Full-Time U.S. Groups  Some Americans - among them scholars and scientists, Congressional delegations, journalists and experts from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii - travel to Vietnam on short visits, but no American organizations work full time there.  Mr. Mochtar, who made a series of trips to Hanoi and Washington earlier this year, says he has come to believe that the conflict in Cambodia stands a better chance of being resolved within the context of improved United States-Vietnamese relations. For this reason, he has been trying to bring about better relations between Hanoi and Washington.  The Foreign Minister is preparing for a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in July between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and the foreign ministers of Asean, in which the members are Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines.  Mr. Mochtar said Friday that he thought Hanoi should concentrate its efforts on the issue of missing Americans as a humanitarian concern and stop viewing it as a bargaining chip.  'Help Them to Help You'  He said he recently told Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, that Vietnam had to be ''forthcoming, or at least seem to be forthcoming on this, so you can turn the tide, which is now running against you.''  ''I know the Americans,'' he said he told the Vietnamese. ''Basically, they are fair. There are still people there who are sympathetic to you. Help them to help you. Make it possible to proceed.  ''The Vietnamese are their own biggest enemy,'' he said, ''because while they are willing to move, publicly they always feel that have to be tough.''  Vietnam, which earlier this year agreed to increase the two nations' consultations on the missing from four a year to six, a few weeks ago abruptly postponed a meeting tentatively scheduled for this month. The talks have been rescheduled for next Wednesday through Friday, according to a Pentagon announcement circulating here. Both sides hope the meeting might in clude the first joint examination of a wartime crash site.  Progress Is Reported  The Vietnamese and the Americans who are close to the talks on the missing had both been reporting encouraging progress.  American officials say the idea of a technical office in Hanoi was first proposed in 1973, the year most American troops were withdrawn and two years before the takeover of Saigon by the North Vietnamese.  According to Americans who were involved with the plan, Hanoi first agreed, then later withdrew its approval. The subject has not been reported to have seriously been raised since then.  Mr. Mochtar said Friday that he was encouraged by the recent American statements that did not rule out a technical office.  ''This news, if it is true, is a very welcome development,'' he said. ''Then we can go somewhere.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",June 29 1985 ,2
"      Vietnam has offered to hold high-level talks with the United States to resolve questions within two years on Americans missing in action, State Department officials said today.  The Hanoi offer, conveyed by Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja of Indonesia four days ago, has received a skeptical response from some Administration officials, who regard it as a possible Hanoi maneuver to deflect attention from repeated criticism of its occupation of Cambodia.  There was also strong suspicion voiced by some officials that the offer was made at this time, virtually on the eve of the annual meeting of the chief non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia, to make Hanoi appear conciliatory, after months of being condemned for its military activity along the Thai-Cambodian border.  Nevertheless, the Administration said it would study the offer to see if it represented a sincere desire by Vietnam to end the continuing problem of the more than 2,400 Americans still listed as missing in action in Indochina, of which some 1,375 are believed to be missing in Vietnam.  'An Enormous Advance'  Officials traveling with Secretary of State George P. Shultz in Hong Kong said the offer appeared ''to be an enormous advance over what has been done so far.''  Since the capture of Saigon by the Communists in 1975, the United States has been calling for a full accounting of the missing in action. The Vietnamese, who have repeatedly said they have no interest in making an issue out of the question, have nonetheless been slow about returning the remains of Americans who died in Vietnam and are still listed as missing.  There has been one report, which is given credence by American officials, that the remains of at least 400 Americans are in a Vietnamese warehouse.  Administration officials long ago concluded that they did not believe any Americans were still alive in Vietnam, but the search for the remains of the Americans has continued.  Concern Over Chinese Influence  Mr. Mochtar, who is one of the most eager of the Southeast Asian leaders to seek an easing of tensions with Vietnam, has been urging for some time active high-level talks between Washington and Hanoi. He has said that if such talks could be held, this might lead to resolution of the missing-in-action issue and eventually provide the impetus for diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.  Earlier, Mr. Mochtar had proposed that Hanoi and Washington agree on establishing an American technical mission in Hanoi in an effort to step up the recovery of remains. It was not clear if the Hanoi message was a response to that proposal.  Indonesia is concerned about a resurgence of Chinese influence in the region and would like Vietnam to be a buffer, but recognizes that Vietnam should first pull out of Cambodia.  Administration officials said today that no consideration would be given to diplomatic relations with Vietnam until it agreed to withdraw from Cambodia. ----U.S. Says It Is Interested HONG KONG, Sunday, July 7 - A senior official traveling with Secretary of State Shultz said today that the United States was willing to hold high-level talks with Vietnam but that the United States continued to insist on a settlement in Cambodia as a condition for improving relations with Hanoi.  The official said a new proposal made by Vietnam to hold talks aimed at resolving the issue of missing Americans within two years appeared ''to be an enormous advance over what has been done so far'' in determining the fate of the more than 2,400 Americans still listed as missing in Indochina. ----Inquiry on Remains Demanded SAN FRANCISCO, July 6 (AP) - A Florida woman demanding independent identification of 13 American servicemen killed in a 1972 plane crash in Laos has won a federal court order barring the Air Force from returning their remains to relatives.  Ann Hart of Pensacola, Fla., the widow of one of the servicemen, obtained the temporary restraining order late Friday night. The remains were received at Travis Air Force Base Friday night.

"    THE Anh-Hong Vietnamese Kitchen in Brentwood may be the only Vietnamese restaurant on Long Island. There was one in Patchogue that closed a few years ago.  Vietnamese cuisine is something of a cross between Thai and Chinese, with the stir-fried dishes, spring rolls and the like that are so typical of Chinese cooking plus the hot spices, pungency and curries that characterize Thai food. For those with a bit of adventure in their palates, the Anh-Hong Vietnamese Kitchen is intriguing and worth trying. But do not expect a grand dining experience. Wear jeans.  Brentwood is not exactly restaurant row, and this storefront take-out shop with its six tables in a small shopping center is strictly utilitarian, like pizzerias and Chinese take-out places nearby. The kitchen is open to view, the place is brightly lighted with fluorescent fixtures, healthy plants fill spare corners and the tables are set only for those who eat in. It is not air-conditioned, but there is a ceiling fan. Paper or plastic plates, flatware and chopsticks, plastic glasses for soft drinks and paper napkins are provided.  The restaurant is owned by a Vietnamese woman, Anh Hong, whose mother had a food stand in the markets of Saigon. Her sons Darryn and Eric assist her with the cooking and service. The three of them are extremely helpful and friendly, ready to make suggestions, to describe the various dishes and sometimes even to offer a taste of something extra.  The lightly seared beef shish kebab - tender, touched with a bit of char and basted with a homemade barbecue sauce - is served on slender wooden skewers for an excellent appetizer. The shrimp toast is like fritters with pieces of small shrimp embedded in the batter, a trifle doughy on the inside but still very good.  Fried spring rolls and egg rolls are filled mostly with vegetables and rice noodles. The egg rolls also contain minced pork, and both are lighter and quite unlike the Chinese versions. Another type of interesting filled roll is wrapped in a rice dough and steamed. Goi cuon is the version made with shrimp, scallions and rice noodles, and bi cuon contains beef.  A steamed rice noodle dish topped with slices of a type of processed meat, chilies and crispy fried noodles and called banh cuon cha lua was somewhat less appealing because the broad steamed rice noodles were rather gummy.  We tried two soups, both forcefully spiced and very savory. Beef stew noodle soup contained chunks of beef, tripe, carrot and onions with noodles in a ruddy, chili-spiced soup. Equally fiery but balanced with a note of astringency was the my tho noodle soup, a shrimp and pork soup served with a jalapeno pepper sauce on the side for those who cannot be faced down by someone else's idea of hot.  One of the most unusual dishes available here is something called banh xeo, which is a bright golden folded cross between an omelet and a crepe and filled with bean sprouts and scallions. It is actually made with cornmeal and served with a sweet homemade duck sauce, colorful, curious but not something worth ordering twice.  Shrimp fried rice is done Vietnamese style with a hauntingly delicious pungency, and the Vietnamese version of chicken with curry sauce consists of nuggets of chicken with the bone, in a smooth, creamy, startingly vibrant pale-yellow sauce flecked with red chilies.  A bed of crispy fried noodles topped with a mixture of beef, pork, shrimp and chicken with bean sprouts, cabbage and celery in a fairly glutinous sauce is called mi xao don. It might be the Vietnamese version of chow mein if such a thing existed. Lo mein moodles topped with a similar assortment of ingredients plus broccoli was quite bland. Chunks of beef with rice noodles and broccoli, called bun nem nuong, was rich and savory, one of the best of the dishes we tried.  Crisp hot banana fritters provide a fine sweet finish. Soft drinks, canned litchi nuts in syrup and ice tea are also available. Bring your own beer for a more appropriate and stronger quaff. It must be said that the disposable tableware does not set the food off to advantage, but considering that it would be difficult to finish more than $10 worth of food (including tax) a person, one can't complain.

"    KONG, July 7   Vietnam has promised to return the remains of 26 more American servicemen who died in the Vietnam War, the largest such turnover since the fighting ended, Americans officials said today.  Officials traveling with Secretary of State George P. Shultz on a tour of Southeast Asia and Australia appeared surprised and delighted at the commitment, which was made to a United States military casualty research group that just ended a three-day mission to Hanoi.  Visit With Cambodia Rebels  On Monday, Mr. Shultz will meet with Thai officials in Bangkok, and on Tuesday he will visit a Cambodian refugee camp inside Thailand on the border with Cambodia. United States officials said Mr. Shultz would meet with two leaders of Cambodia's non-Communist resistance movement in Bangkok.  Hanoi's offer to return the Americans' remains followed a Vietnamese proposal last week to open talks aimed at clearing up the question of missing Americans within two years, a proposal that the American officials said they intended to explore quickly.  ''I think in this meeting we had expected some concrete results; the magnitude of what we got was unexpected,'' said a Reagan Administration official who has been involved in trying to determine the fate of the 2,400 Americans listed as missing in Indochina, more than half of them in Vietnam.  All Were Military Personnel  The officials traveling with Mr. Shultz said Vietnam had provided names for all of the 26 people whose remains were to be turned over and had said all were military personnel.  They said the remains would be processed by the Joint Casualty Research Center in Hawaii to confirm the identifications before families were notified. They added that they had established that some of the names on the list matched servicemen known to have been taken prisoner, but who never came out of Vietnam.  The American officials reported the Vietnamese had said the remains were found ''in the provinces'' and had given no further explanation.  It is expected to take six to eight weeks to complete arrangements for the turnover, the officials said. They said the Vietnamese had also provided ''material evidence or information'' on six other missing Americans.  Until now, the largest number of Americans whose remains were provided by Vietnam was around 20 in 1975, one official said. Since then, remains have been turned over sporadically in groups of six to eight at a time.  Crash Site Is Surveyed  The primary activity of the technical group that visited Vietnam last week was to survey the site of a B-52 crash as a step toward excavation, the officials said. They said that Hanoi had not made a commitment to excavate the site but that a survey to determine the time and manpower required to do so was a normal preliminary.  A senior Administration official said that before responding to Vietnam's expressed willingness to settle the question, the United States must ''define clearly on our side'' what needs to be done to accomplish the work on a two-year schedule. The officials indicated that they would do this as quickly as possible, adding that two years was not too long a time considering the large number of sites that will probably have to be excavated.  ''On the technical level, what we are talking about is mid-rank military people digging the mud, essentially,'' one of the officials said.  The technical mission made one of six such visits to Vietnam that are permitted each year under an agreement worked out early this year.  The American officials here said the United States was willing to consider establishing a permanent technical presence in Hanoi if that became necessary to facilitate the search for and processing of remains, but they stressed that that was not to be interpreted as movement toward normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi. They said that still depended upon Vietnam's ending its military occupation of Cambodia.  But a senior official said the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, who is serving as a go-between for Vietnam and the United States, had told the Vietnamese that while the Cambodian occupation stood in the way of normal relations, the issue of the missing Americans also constituted an obstacle.  The officials said that while Vietnam's latest proposal spoke of ''high-level talks,'' it was expected that contacts would continue to be between the Vietnamese Foreign Minister and various assistant secretaries of state or defense or senior members of the National Security Council. Five such meetings have been held in the last three years, they said. ---- #100 Bodies Already Returned WASHINGTON, July 7 - A State Department official said today that Vietnam had previously returned the remains of about 100 American soldiers.  Every time remains have been returned, Vietnam has asserted that the bodies were recently discovered and that it knew of no others, the official said. He said Washington was skeptical of such claims because some of the remains were of servicemen known to have been captured in Vietnam.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 7 1985 ,3
"    LUMPUR, Malaysia, July 10   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that the Reagan Administration was ready to work ''promptly and decisively'' with Vietnam to resolve the issue of missing Americans.  In his first public response to a request for ''high level'' talks on the issue passed from Hanoi to Washington last week by Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja of Indonesia, Mr. Shultz said at a news conference at the United States Embassy here today:  ''I think the next step for us is - as we will be doing - to organize the kind of group we think would be best able to respond and to let them know in Hanoi that we'd like to start to work on this problem. We want to work at it as promptly and decisively as possible.''  Mr. Shultz's comments followed a decision by Vietnam last week to turn over the remains of 26 Americans thought to have died in Indochina. This was the largest repatriation of remains of M.I.A.'s - missing in action - announced since 1975, when South Vietnam fell to the armies of the North, two years after the withdrawal of American forces. More than 2,400 Americans are still listed as missing in Indochina, over half of them in Vietnam.  Criticizes Congress on Cambodia  In his remarks today, Mr. Shultz was also critical of Congress for what he called its ''changeability'' as he expressed the Administration's reservations about Congressional efforts to provide non-Communist forces battling Vietnamese troops in Cambodia with $5 million that could be used for military aid. The measure was approved by the House of Representatives on Tuesday.  ''I think we're going to have greater success in our program if we keep it the way it is now,'' he said, referring to the Administration's limiting of aid to mostly humanitarian expenditures.  ''Congress is a very changeable operation,'' he said. ''They are in favor of something at one time and then some things can happen and they can change their mind and you've got a program that's working that gets derailed. We'd like to avoid that.''  Mr. Shultz is in Kuala Lumpur for annual consultations with ministers of the member nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines.  The Secretary, asked by reporters to clear up a misunderstanding about whether he had brought Thailand a new letter of support from President Reagan, said he had not presented such a document to Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda when they met in Bangkok on Monday. But he indicated that the subject had come up in their conversation when the Thai leader referred to an letter Mr. Reagan sent last April. The letter pledged backing for Thailand in the face of what both countries view as Vietnam's threatening presence in Cambodia.  In his answers to questions at the news conference, he indicated that the United States was prepared to deal with Vietnam directly at a high level. Officials traveling in the Shultz party have suggested that Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, might be among officials likely to visit Hanoi, with which the United States has no formal diplomatic relations.  Indonesian Is Thanked  Mr. Shultz thanked Foreign Minister Mochtar of Indonesia, with whom he will meet privately Thursday, for his efforts in ''supporting our concerns about the M.I.A.-P.O.W. issue.'' He added that on the larger issue of diplomatic ties, Washington would prefer to act on its own.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 10 1985 ,2
"    LUMPUR, Malaysia, July 11   ''I'm a pretty persuasive fellow, don't you think?'' Mochtar Kusumaatmadja asks, interrupting one of his characteristic monologues with one of his characteristic asides.  Mr. Mochtar, Foreign Minister of Indonesia, likes a challenge, and right now he has a big one on his agenda. This lawyer and diplomat, a Yale Law School graduate, has taken on the job of trying to improve relations between the United States and Vietnam.  A former law professor and Justice Minister before becoming Foreign Minister, the 56-year-old Mr. Mochtar never has fewer than two or three projects in progress. Acquaintances say he recently wrote two law books at the same time while having a hand in the development of a new Indonesian cuisine that is featured at a local hotel's best dining room.  Gratitude From Shultz  This morning, Mr. Mochtar had breakfast with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who is in Malaysia for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Mr. Shultz urged the group to continue its efforts to draft a peace plan for Vietnamese-occupied Cambodia. At breakfast, he thanked Mr. Mochtar for ''supporting our concerns'' about the issue of American servicemen missing in Indochina since the Vietnam War.  The Foreign Minister was born in Jakarta on Feb. 17, 1929. He is devoted to the music of West Java, and has just created a foundation to promote Indonesian culture abroad.  Energetic, sometimes noisy, and always expressive, he bounds from one appointment to another. Careful to stay within the bounds of what President Suharto describes as his nonaligned and nonconfrontational foreign policy, Mr. Mochtar is always in touch with the Presidential Palace while abroad. He seems, diplomats say, to have the Foreign Minister's job for as long as he wants it.  Mr. Mochtar's role as mediator between Hanoi and Washington is one he created for himself while serving as a go-between in Hanoi for the non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia in their efforts to end the Cambodian war. He says he concluded that a ''new element'' had to be added to the stalemated efforts to solve the problem, and that that element was more American contact with Vietnam, whose troops are now occupying Cambodia.  Urging a Vietnamese Move  Mr. Mochtar, who is in Kuala Lumpur for a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, followed by consultations with Mr. Shultz, said in a recent interview in his Jakarta office that he has been urging the Vietnamese to make some meaningful gesture to the United States ''fairly quickly.''  Last week, Hanoi passed a message through Mr. Mochtar asking Washington to consider high-level talks on resolving the issue of Americans still missing in action in Vietnam, 12 years after the withdrawal of United States forces.  Foreign Minister Mochtar (his name is pronounced to rhyme with ''doctor'') says he understands Americans - whom he calls ''a very fair people'' - and their institutions. Beneath the understanding, he says, is a deep sense of gratitude for personal help he got from the United States at the lowest point in his life.  ''I will never forget those years,'' he said. ''I will never forget what you Americans did for me.''  The time was 1964, when Mr. Mochtar, a graduate of the University of Indonesia and the law school at Pajajaran University in Bandung, was summarily dismissed from his post as head of the law faculty at Pajajaran by President Sukarno.  Mr. Mochtar, who had been lecturing to army officers on human rights and humanitarian law, said it was his ''independence of mind'' that got him in trouble.  ''Indoctrination was the order of the day,'' he said of the last Sukarno years. ''I was dean of the law school, and I could not accept that. So I got on the wrong side of the Government.''  Aid of Former Professor  Without a job and unsure of the Government's next move, Mr. Mochtar was helped by Myres S. McDougal, a former professor of Mr. Mochtar's at Yale, where he had studied in the mid-1950's.  ''He was determined to come to Bandung and look me up, against the advice of the American Embassy,'' Mr. Mochtar said. ''I was persona non grata, you see. I was an outcast. In a hostile environment like that anything could happen.''  Professor McDougal helped Mr. Mochtar get a private foundation scholarship to come to the United States. A year at Harvard Law School and another as a research fellow at the University of Chicago followed.  Mr. Mochtar took his wife, Ida, and their young children - Emir, who is now a lawyer; Armida, an economist, and Askari, who is now in high school - to the United States. He recalls family conferences around American kitchen tables as they anguished over what the future might bring.  ''I know what it feels to be an exile,'' he said. By the time Mr. Mochtar returned to Indonesia two years later, after the fall of President Sukarno, he had acquired a background in economic and developmental law. He is a leading expert on the law of the sea.  Offered reinstatement at Pajajaran University Law School, he agreed, but insisted on the right to set up his own law firm at the same time. ''I had learned my lesson about a government job,'' he said.  Mr. Mochtar said it is his concern for law and human rights for which he would like to be known. He said that he was instrumental in smoothing the way for the International Committee of the Red Cross to work in Indonesia after a rebellion was put down in Sumatra, and that he was critical of reported armed forces abuses later in East Timor.

"    LUMPUR, Malaysia, July 12   Japan told the United States today that by the end of the month the Government would have a plan of action to deal with trade problems between the two countries, a senior State Department official said.  The outline of the plan was presented to Secretary of State George P. Shultz today by Japan's Foreign Minister, Shintaro Abe, at a private meeting. Both men were in Kuala Lumpur for three days of annual consultations with Southeast Asian and Pacific leaders. Mr. Shultz left tonight for Australia. The Secretary of State met today with the Foreign Ministers of the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines - and with a delegation from New Zealand. Mr. Shultz also took part in wider talks, involving Australia and Canada, on trade and security issues in the Pacific.  Proposal for Talks Supported  Mr. Shultz gave his support to an association proposal to convene talks on Cambodia among, on the one hand, the Vietnamese and the Vietnam-backed Government headed by Heng Samrin in Phnom Penh, and, on the other hand, the opposition coalition fighting to oust Hanoi's troops from Cambodia. But Vietnam appears to have ruled out any talks based on the regional group's formula.  In the hour-and-a-half private meeting between Mr. Abe and Mr. Shultz, the Administration official said, the Japanese Foreign Minister outlined six areas in which Japan would propose ideas for joint action.  These would cover tariff issues left unresolved by the June 25 Japanese statement on changes in trade policy, certification procedures, import restrictions and impediments, procurement policies, access for service industries and capital market measures.  The American official who briefed reporters said the Japanese Foreign Minister had provided the most detail in his outline of possible changes in certification procedures. He said the Japanese appeared to be prepared to curtail bureaucracy and allow more self-certification by importers.  Mr. Abe was also reported to have said that Tokyo was considering ways to open the regulatory process, giving affected parties the right to comment on rules and decisions.  Fears About Soviet Power  In their discussions with Mr. Shultz this week, several regional nations expressed fears about what they regard as Soviet penetration into the Pacific, American officials said. The Soviet Union, which has naval facilities in Vietnam and Cambodia, has also been seeking closer ties with small island nations. The official said Indonesia and New Zealand pointed in particular to a fishing agreement negotiated recently between Moscow and Kiribati, which lies about 2,200 miles northeast of Australia.  Mr. Shultz told Asian leaders that he was in favor of holding discussions with Moscow on regional problems, a course endorsed by President Reagan last fall. The American official said that it was possible that Asian topics would be raised when the Secretary of State meets the new Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in two weeks, but that no specific plans had been made for such talks.  Plan for 'Proximity Talks'  Mr. Shultz's statement of support for the Asean ministers' call for talks on Cambodia was inserted this morning into a prepared speech that Mr. Shultz decided at the last minute not to deliver, so that more time could be spent on discussions.  The plan is for discussions that have become known here as ''proximity talks'' because representatives of warring sides would communicate through an intermediary and would not meet face to face.  Before it was formally announced here Tuesday, the plan was rejected by Vietnam on the ground that the Southeast Asian group, under pressure from Thailand, had proposed that Vietnam take part as the de facto power in Cambodia. Hanoi holds that only the Heng Samrin Government should make decisions on Cambodia's future.  Today, the Vietnamese Embassy in Kuala Lumpur expressed its ''surprise'' that Asean should still be pursuing the proposal. One minister from the association remarked that by his count this was the association's 13th proposal on talks, all of which had been rejected by the Vietnamese.  Interest in a 'Safety Zone'  Mr. Shultz was reported to have expressed interest today in a proposal made to him by Singapore that an internationally supervised ''safety zone'' be created inside Cambodia that would allow the more than 230,000 Cambodians displaced by a Vietnamese offensive to return to the country from their refuges in Thailand.  The Secretary of State, who has referred several times this week to the deep impression made on him by the plight of the Cambodians in camps along the Thai-Cambodian border, which he visited Tuesday, told the Southeast Asian leaders that the United States would turn its attention toward ways of providing them more assistance, the American official said.  Mr. Shultz appears to prefer to limit the aid to humanitarian programs, technical training and education, according to the official. A team from the United States Agency for International Development has just completed a study of border needs, the official said.  The House and the Senate have approved legislation that would give the Administration the option of granting military assistance.  In the past, Vietnam has not opposed the creation of a security zone in the border area, but it has said such a zone should straddle the frontier. Southeast Asian leaders say Thailand would never accept a loss of complete control over its own territory.  Regional officials also question whether Hanoi, having driven the Cambodian guerrillas into Thailand in a large offensive last winter, would be prepared to see them return under any circumstances short of complete disarmament and surrender.

"      THERE was optimism last week among many Government officials - and among surviving family members - that the mystery of 2,464 Americans still unaccounted for after the war in Indochina may be closer to resolution.  A United States-sponsored research group that completed a three-day mission in Hanoi early this month reported that the Vietnamese had promised to return the remains of 26 American servicemen and ''material evidence'' regarding the fate of six others. It would be the largest such turnover in the 10 years since the fighting ended.  Potentially more significant, members of the group reported, the Vietnamese took them to a B-52 crash site outside of Hanoi, and left the impression they may be willing, after years of entreaties, to permit a search of the wreckage of other downed aircraft.  The Pentagon believes there are ''several hundred'' such crash sites in Vietnam that may contain enough evidence to close the books on many of the 1,820 missing in that country.  A week earlier, another American team completed its first excavation in Laos, where 556 Americans remain on the missing list. A two-week sifting of a nearly obliterated AC-130 gunship shot down in 1972 produced 13 identifiable sets of remains.  Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense for international security affairs, said that so far the Vietnamese had made no commitment to allow American teams in, but he regarded the B-52 visit as ''an indication that they're certainly leaning in that direction.''  Signal of a Policy Decision  The developments came after a Vietnamese proposal to open talks aimed at resolving questions about the missing Americans within two years.  ''We've never before had this large a turnover, or any kind of a time commitment,'' said Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of P.O.W.-M.I.A. Families. ''It signals a policy decision on their part, and we obviously welcome that.'' ''That doesn't mean we're near the end,'' she added.  Nor does it touch on the matter of whether any Americans are still in captivity in Vietnam. A special House committee concluded in 1976 that ''no Americans are still being held alive as prisoners in Indochina, or elsewhere, as a result of the war in Indochina.''  The chairman of the panel, Representative G. V. Montgomery, Democrat of Mississippi, still gets periodic briefings from Pentagon intelligence specialists.  ''They can't give me a name,'' Mr. Montgomery said last week. ''They can't give me strong evidence.'' A panel appointed by President Carter also concluded that there were no captives.  The Nature of the 'Evidence'  The Administration has been less inclined to rule out that possibility. The official view today, Mr. Armitage said, is: ''We act under the assumption that there is at least one American held against his will in Indochina.''  The ''evidence'' regarding captives appears to consist almost entirely of reports from Vietnamese refugees who say they once saw what they thought were Americans. The Pentagon has recorded 774 such reported sightings; so far, most of the eyewitness accounts either have involved Americans who returned or have been discounted, sometimes with the assistance of lie-detector tests, as fabrications.  That leaves 123 sightings still being examined, according to officials.  Col. Gerald S. Venanzi, a former prisoner of the Vietnamese who is the Pentagon's senior adviser on P.O.W. and M.I.A. affairs, said there is little even in those active files to raise hopes.  Very few of the witnesses mention talking to the alleged American captives. Half are sightings of white men not under guard - possibly Russian advisers, European diplomats or reporters. Only two of the reported sightings have taken place since 1980, and 18 were before the fall of Saigon.  ''A lot among that 123 are just so vague that there is no place to go with them,'' Colonel Venanzi said. ''There's nothing I'd want to take to the store and say, 'This is it, boss.' ''  Still, he is convinced ''there's a lot to investigate.'' The M.I.A. search office told Congress last month it has ''a virtually unlimited budget'' for the cause.  Some critics feel the Administration has exploited the missing Americans. Every year, families of the missing servicemen have been airlifted to Washington for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Recognition Day - some 800 are expected to fly in at Government expense for a gathering on Friday. On such occasions, the hope has been encouraged that some of the missing will emerge alive.  To those who say such displays raise false hope or smack too much of political showmanship, Mr. Armitage replies that they have paid off, perhaps convincing Hanoi that any hope of normal diplomatic relations depends on as full a reckoning as possible.  No one expects that all of the missing Americans will ever be accounted for. Many are presumed to have crashed into the sea or dense jungle, and the tropical climate quickly destroys evidence.  About 8,100 Americans still remain unaccounted for from the Korean war, and more than 78,000 from World War II, where the United States had the victor's advantage of unimpeded access to former battlefields and crash sites.  At what point will the Administration be satisfied?  Said Mr. Armitage: ''It's kind of like enlightenment. You know when you're there.''

"      The music of the Army Band was punctuated by the firing of the four cannon. Minutes later, the helicopters were seen in the distance.  They came in low, their 10 sets of propellers beating furiously. As they climbed the small hill and prepared to fly over the Pentagon, one suddenly peeled off, trailing a plume of purple smoke. The crowd below saw, heard, felt the other nine streak overhead.  It was yet another episode in a war that President Reagan has said has never ended, at least for the families and friends of the 2,464 Americans still officially listed as unaccounted for, most of them in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Today, by the President's declaration, was National P.O.W./M.I.A. Recognition Day.  'A Special Duty'  Here in the capital, the band and the helicopters were part of a Recognition Day ceremony at the Pentagon. More than 1,000 families and friends of prisoners of war and those missing in action waited on the shadeless lawn to hear Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reassure them that the Administration has not forgotten their loved ones.  ''We in the military services have a special duty to those who served with us in combat,'' he said. Then, echoing the President, the general said: ''We write no last chapters. We close no books.'' America's involvement will not end, he said, until there has been a full accounting for those still missing.  The Pentagon ceremony, opened by Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft 4th with a 19-gun salute and closed by the helicopters in a ''Missing Man'' formation, was part of remembrances all across the country. It also coincided with the 16th annual national convention of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, meeting in suburban Alexandria, Va.  Vice President Bush spoke to the group in the afternoon, but his was not the name on everybody's lips. ''Rambo,'' it seems, was the favorite topic of speculation and discussion. Taken from the current motion picture about a Vietnam veteran who returns to rescue American P.O.W.'s, the name is also associated with a faction of the League of Families that wants the league, and the Government, to take more decisive action toward recovering the missing.  Mr. Bush did his part to fuel the hopes and answer the prayers of the convention-goers, announcing that the Laotian Government agreed this week to excavate the site of a United States jet crash in an effort to recover the remains of the fliers. It was reported earlier this month that a joint Laotian-United States excavation of another crash site, in Pakse, in eastern Laos, had produced 13 identifiable sets of remains.  One unifying element among those attending the convention is the feeling that Washington is not being honest with the families of the missing.  Two sisters from the West Coast, in their first trip to the national convention, thought for one hopeful moment that they had learned something about the whereabouts of their father, a Navy aviator shot down in the war zone more than 10 years ago. The sisters saw a Defense Department file today that indicated the father had survived and had been taken prisoner, but hours later they were told by Pentagon officials that the notification was merely a form letter that did not refer to their father and had made its way into his file by mistake.  Even the efforts the Administration is making to recover the missing in Laos are met with skepticism. The Government says the remains of an Air Force crew member, George MacDonald, shot down in a AC-130 gunship over Laos in 1972, were among those recovered in the Pakse excavation and were returned to Travis Air Force Base in California earlier this month. His brother Gregory is not so sure. ''I'm just distrustful of the Government's position,'' he said.  The suspicion stems from a lawsuit filed in the case of another Air Force man, Lieut. Col. Thomas T. Hart, that says the Air Force does not actually know whether the identities assigned to the recovered Pakse remains are accurate. A declaration filed in the suit by a forensic expert says it is impossible to determine whether the remains identified as Colonel Hart's are, in fact, his or whether they are even from the same person.  It is evidence like this that leaves people like Gregory MacDonald wondering. ''I don't know what the Government's motivation is,'' he said. ''There are so many upset people out there who feel there's been a fraud perpetrated.''  Debbie Stein of St. Louis says her brother, Cpl. Larry Green, has been missing since 1968. Her attitude might be indicative of the attitude of most of the crowd at the convention. She feels that ceremonies, like today's at the Pentagon, are too little, too late, but she is heartened by recent developments in talks with the Vietnamese and the Laotians, and she intends to give her support at next year's convention.  Still, she mused, ''It would be nice if there wasn't a next year.''

"   , Thailand, July 20   Laos said today that it would send a team of officials to Hawaii to join the United States in preparing for a search for servicemen missing in action from the war in Indochina.  Laos told the United States Embassy in Vientiane Thursday that it had accepted an American invitation to send a delegation to the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Honolulu late this year, the Laotian press agency said in a broadcast monitored in Bangkok.  The agency said Laos was preparing for a joint excavation of the crash site of a United States aircraft during the next November-to-May dry season.  It said Laos pledged further cooperation in the search for missing servicemen and expressed hope ''the U.S. Government will take concrete, reasonable steps responding to this humanitarian and good-will attitude.''

"      The United States proposed to Vietnam today that an American delegation go to Hanoi to discuss Vietnam's recent offer to resolve the missing-in-action issue, a State Department spokesman said.  The department spokesman, Bernard Kalb, said the proposed delegation would include officials from the Defense and State Departments, the National Security Council and the executive director of the National League of Families. He said he could not name the delegation members.  According to Mr. Kalb, there will be no change in United States policy toward Vietnam. There are 2,464 Americans still listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia, most of them in Vietnam.  The proposal was issued today through the United States Embassy in Bangkok in response to a Vietnamese offer, made in July, to resolve the issue within two years.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 14   The Government today turned over what may be the remains of 26 Americans missing in the Vietnam War. It also indicated acceptance of a proposed visit by senior United States officials later this month to resolve the entire issue of the missing in action.  Today an American team took custody of the latest remains and, after a ceremony, they were flown to Honolulu for analysis. If they can be identified, they would represent Vietnam's largest single delivery of remains since the end of the war.  The bones given to the American delegation today were packed in 26 numbered crates. A folded American flag was placed on top of each and they were carried one by one onto a C-130 transport plane as 18 United States soldiers, sailors and airmen saluted.  Vietnamese officials also provided unspecified material evidence, including identification tags, from six other servicemen missing in action, Previously Vietnam had handed over the remains of 99 missing, but 2,464 American servicemen and civilians are still unaccounted for in Indochina, more than half of them in Vietnam. The previous largest single delivery of remains was 22 sets of bones, in 1977.  On the American visit, for which a date has yet to be set, Col. Vo Dong Giang, a Deputy Foreign Minister, told reporters, ''I am confident in telling you that the proposal is acceptable.''  Diplomatic sources in Bangkok, Thailand, said the United States delegation would include Paul D. Wolfowitz, an Assistant Secretary of State; Richard L. Armitage, an Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Richard Childress, a member of the National Security Council staff. Mr. Armitage led a team here in February 1984.  Washington and Hanoi do not have diplomatic relations. Although the visit would not involve recognition of the Vietnamese Government, diplomatic sources said, it would have symbolic significance.  Colonel Giang said Vietnam would try to resolve the issue of the missing in the next two years, exerting ''our greatest efforts to find the remains until we believe that no matter what efforts, no more remains will be found.''  He expressed the hope that the United States would refrain from hostile statements so that Vietnam could resolve its security problems and concentrate on economic development.

"    Vietnam took a step last week toward improving relations with the United States. It turned over the remains of 26 people who may have been among the 2,464 American servicemen missing when the Vietnam war ended in 1974.  A Vietnamese doctor said that, with the help of photographs, the remains of 20 of the men had been identified as Americans. No photographs had been available to identify five others, he said; the 26th person was an ethnic Asian. The remains were flown to Honolulu for analysis. Vietnam also turned over identification tags and other evidence from six other missing servicemen.  Until last week, Hanoi had returned remains of only 99 of the men missing in action in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Some American officials have suggested that Vietnam is holding the remains of 400 others in hopes of negotiating concessions from the United States.  Vietnam also indicated last week its readiness to talk to a delegation of senior American officials in Hanoi on Aug. 28-29. Paul Wolfowitz, an Assistant Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, an Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Richard Childress, a National Security Council aide, are expected to go. Secretary of State George P. Shultz recently said he wanted to work on clearing up the issue of the missing servicemen ''as promptly and as decisively as possible.'' The United States has refused to establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam until the issue of the missing servicemen is resolved and until Vietnam ends its occupation of Cambodia. There has been no discernible progress on Cambodia.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo of U.S. loading remains of M.I.A.'s onto plane in Hanoi(AP)                      ",August 18 1985 ,3
"      A United States delegation scheduled to meet with Vietnamese officials to discuss the fate of missing American servicemen postponed its departure for Hanoi today after learning that Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach would not be present for the meetings next week.  The Vietnamese Government announced in July that it was prepared to resolve within two years the question of Americans missing in action, and wanted to hold high-level talks to discuss it. Nearly 2,500 Americans are listed as missing in the Indochina war, more than half of them in Vietnam.  The American delegation that had been scheduled to leave Saturday planned to spend two days in Hanoi and half a day in Laos.  A State Department statement said only that the delegation ''may have to reschedule'' the trip because of ''some difficulty in scheduling participation on the Vietnamese side.''  A senior Administration official said Mr. Thach's participation was considered crucial. Mr. Thach was in Indonesia this week and there were unconfirmed reports he had gone on to Moscow. The official said there was hope that the Vietnamese would offer ''clarification'' and that the delegation could leave with a delay of only a day or two.

"      The Reagan Administration said today that talks last week with Vietnamese officials in Hanoi were ''the most positive'' to date in the 12-year effort to resolve the problem of Americans unaccounted for in the Vietnam War.  A State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said that ''I am pleased to state that the talks were very productive'' and that the meeting ''took place in a constructive atmosphere.''  Last Wednesday and Thursday, a four-member United States team led by Richard Childress, the political and military affairs director of the National Security Council staff, met with the acting Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Vo Dong Giang, and with Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son.  Originally, a higher-level American delegation, led by Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, had been scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach. But when Mr. Thach informed Washington on Aug. 23 that he had to travel to Moscow, Mr. Armitage and Mr. Wolfowitz canceled plans at the last minute to fly to Hanoi.  The assumption at that time in Washington was that the Vietnamese, who at first had proposed ''high-level talks'' to resolve the question of unaccounted-for Americans ''in two years,'' were having second thoughts. The lower-level Childress mission was authorized to have ''technical talks.''  State Department officials said today that Mr. Childress, who was accompanied by Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, was surprised to find the Vietnamese officials ready, even at the secondary level, to discuss for the first time all aspects of the issue.  ''This was the first time that we had a totally nonpolemical discussion with the Vietnamese,'' a State Department official said. ''They did not raise any preconditions for cooperation.'' In previous meetings, Hanoi had indicated that progress on the missing-in-action issue depended on the United States improving relations with Vietnam or granting it foreign aid.  Neither issue was raised this time, but American officials believe that Hanoi still hopes to achieve both.  During the talks, Mr. Redman said, the United States conveyed to the Vietnamese ''an outline of a process to resolve the issue in Vietnam within two years.'' Vietnam ''presented its own plan to resolve the issue in a short time.''  'A Number of Common Elements'  ''There are a number of common elements between the two concepts,'' he said.  A total of 1,820 Americans in Vietnam are carried on one of two rolls - those who were at one time listed as prisoners of war, or missing in action, and those who were believed to be killed in action but whose bodies have not been recovered. Despite movies that portray Americans being held in Vietnam, State Department officials said there is no evidence to indicate that any are alive. But there is a desire, they said, to clear up questions raised by reported sightings of Westerners who could be Americans.  According to State Department officials, the United States suggested a three-part approach to the Vietnamese: first, to obtain the release of any prisoners or at least to resolve the issue of live prisoners; second, for the Vietnamese to step up their efforts to recover the remains of dead Americans; and third, to undertake surveys and excavations in areas where the United States believes remains may be found.  The thrust of the American plan, a State Department official said, was for joint American-Vietnamese efforts, with American teams being allowed to observe the Vietnamese efforts and to aid in the search.  The Vietnamese, in their plan, put the stress on increased Vietnamese efforts and showed little enthusiasm for joint teams, but did not rule the idea out, an official said.  Hanoi Denies G.I.'s Are Alive  Hanoi denies that any missing Americans are still alive, officials said.  The most contentious issue deals with the Vietnamese turning over remains. Washington believes that Hanoi has stored the remains of hundreds of Americans, some of which it returns periodically to the United States. Most recently, Hanoi turned over the remains of 26 Americans. Altogether, Vietnam has returned the remains of 99 men.  State Department officials said the Vietnamese seem much more determined to deal with the question of the unaccounted-for Americans. ''They know they have to do so to improve relations with us,'' one State Department official said.  ''We believe the talks were the most positive step yet in the ongoing process toward resolution of this issue,'' Mr. Redman said.  Ever since the cease-fire agreement was signed in 1973 on ending the Vietnam War, the United States has been seeking a full accounting of its men in Vietnam. But the effort has had the highest priority in the Reagan Administration, which was critical of the way past administrations dealt with the question.  The United States has said it would not improve relations with Hanoi until the missing-in-action question was resolved and until Hanoi withdrew its forces from Cambodia. The Vietnamese have occupied Cambodia since crushing the Communist Government of Pol Pot in early 1979 but have recently said they foresaw pulling out by 1990. There are believed to be about 160,000 Vietnamese in Cambodia bolstering the Government of Heng Samrin.  U.S. Comments on Pol Pot  In another development, the State Department said it would be ''a positive step'' if Pol Pot, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, has actually retired from active command of his forces. Since the Vietnamese victory over his forces in 1979, Mr. Pol Pot has led the Khmer Rouge in a continuing insurgency, with the aid of China. There are two non-Communist rebel groups in Cambodia, one led by the former chief of state, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and the other by Son Sann, a former official in the old Cambodian Government.  Because the Pol Pot regime has been charged with the deaths of more than two million Cambodians during its rule, the United States and most other countries have had no contact with it.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 14   Vietnam today announced the devaluation of its currency for the second time in less than six months, according to a Hanoi radio broadcast monitored here.  Hanoi also canceled all flights in and out of the country.  Officials of the Vietnamese Embassy here were not available for comment.  The moves followed a Vietnamese decision to stop supplying subsidized rations to Government employees.  Until this week the currency, the dong, was worth about 350 to 400 to the dollar on the black market. But on Friday it was reported to be selling unofficially at 1,000 to the dollar in Ho Chi Minh City.  Vietnam, a country of about 60 million, last devalued its currency in April. At that time the official rate of about 11 dong to the dollar was changed to 100 to the dollar.  In both the north and south of the country, however, illegal currency exchanges have become standard practice, with Vietnamese in shops and on the streets crossing wrists in front of foreigners to indicate they wanted to buy hard currency.

There are still 1,369 Americans listed as missing in action in Vietnam and a total of 2,464 in all of Indochina.  The technical team, led by Col.

"      Although the United States is sending a high-level delegation to Hanoi next week, there has been no visible movement toward formal diplomatic relations.  Officials believe Hanoi is ready for normal relations, partly as a balance with its involvement with the Soviet Union, but also to rebuff China and to obtain American investment in such fields as offshore oil exploration. Vietnamese officials have welcomed private Americans who have urged reconciliation and exchange programs. A group of educators is to visit Vietnam this week, for example, to lay the groundwork for a teacher exchange.  But more than 10 years after the end of the Vietnam War, the United States continues to resist diplomatic relations, citing as the latest obstacle the presence of an estimated 140,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. Hanoi, which invaded in 1978, accuses China of having used Cambodia as a surrogate to attack Vietnam.  ''We will not normalize until this is resolved to allow the Khmer people to have free choice,'' Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense, said in a recent interview.  Highest Delegation Since '77  Mr. Armitage is going to Hanoi with Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and with Richard Childress, political and military affairs director of the National Security Council staff at the White House.  It is the highest-level delegation since 1977, when Leonard Woodcock, then president of the United Auto Workers, was sent by President Carter to explore opening diplomatic relations. Those efforts fell victim to a series of events in 1978, including the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and the establishment of Chinese-American relations.  The talks next week are to focus on the other major issue between Hanoi and Washington: accounting for Americans missing in action.  ''The Vietnamese have indicated greater cooperation on this issue than was evident heretofore,'' Mr. Armitage said.  In recent months, he said, Vietnam has returned remains of Americans at a faster rate and has allowed an American team to search a B-52 crash site, the first of a series to be explored.  Plan Presented by Hanoi  In August, Mr. Armitage said, Vietnamese officials presented the United States with a plan to obtain and provide as much information on the missing as possible by the end of 1987. Consequently, the Administration has adopted the view that accounting for the missing is ''not a precondition to any sort of normalization,'' as Mr. Armitage put it.  In a wider sense, however, it has political impact on American attitudes.  ''They know fully and without a doubt that this issue is not going to go away,'' Mr. Armitage said. ''It is not a precondition. But it is a simple fact of life that the American people will not stand for normalization until this problem is resolved.''  The lingering preoccupation with the missing and the unwillingness to establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam are seen by some Americans as symptoms of an inability to heal the wounds of war.  ''For Americans, there is no closure,'' said John McAuliff, director of the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, a program of the SANE Education Fund. ''There has begun to be individual closure, with individuals making the trip back to Vietnam. But more important, there is no societal closure in which one can really say things are back to normal, the country is at peace.''  A Former Antiwar Activist  Mr. McAuliff, who was interviewed before heading for Vietnam with the educators, is one of several antiwar activists who have turned their efforts to improving American-Vietnamese ties. He believes that formal relations would have concrete benefits for both sides.  Diplomatic recognition by Washington, he said, ''would encourage sectors of the Vietnamese Government that take a more reformist and liberal approach and a more trusting approach to their people.''  There could also be joint research, he said, into the effects of dioxin, a toxic chemical contained in the defoliant Agent Orange, which was used by United States forces in Vietnam.  Dioxin has been found in the soil of some American communities. Its effect on health could be measured by examining South Vietnamese residents who have high levels in their bodies, Mr. McAuliff said. Effect on Vietnamese in U.S.  He said normalization would also make it possible for Vietnamese living in the United States to visit Vietnam and would have an effect on their politics here.  ''As long as there is not normalization,'' Mr. McAuliff said, ''it kind of feeds the hopes of the right-wing activists in the Vietnamese community that they can somehow stage a return. Once the U.S. recognizes that there is a single, unified Vietnam, it really does say to people, 'Look, you have to make your lives here now.' ''  From Vietnam's standpoint, American officials and Asian diplomats observe, relations with Washington could help an ailing economy. The present trade embargo inhibits Vietnam's purchase of spare parts for American equipment left behind at the end of the war. It has also created a vacuum into which the Soviet Union has stepped with an estimated $1 billion a year in aid.  Since North Vietnamese troops rolled into Saigon in April 1975 and the last Americans left in helicopters from the United States Embassy roof, Vietnam has been drawn into a relationship of both dependence on and wariness of the Soviet Union. Dependent for aid to its flagging economy and military strength against a hostile China, it has entered into elaborate trade, diplomatic and military agreements with Moscow.  Determined to Be Autonomous  But Vietnamese officials also emphasize their determination to remain autonomous, an effort that took several forms in the first years after 1975. One was a demand for United States ''reparations'' for damage caused in the war as a condition for diplomatic ties.  One Hanoi official recently said that condition was ''a mistake'' and had infuriated Americans. The demand was dropped in December 1977.  In addition, Vietnam initially resisted Soviet pressure to use American-built military bases in Cam Ranh Bay, Da Nang and elsewhere. The aversion has diminished over the years, and the Russians have gradually gained a military presence.  According to Mr. Armitage, an average of 25 Soviet Navy vessels, including submarines, are moored in Cam Ranh Bay at any given time. MIG-23 jet fighters and long-range aircraft are based there and at Da Nang, he said, with the MIG's scheduled to be turned over to the Vietnamese.  Still, in conversations with Westerners, Vietnamese officials stress their desire not to become to the Soviet Union what the Philippines are to the United States, an allusion to the freedom of the United States to use bases in the Philippines as it wishes.  Fear of China Is Deep  But Vietnam's fear of China, rooted deeply in history, keeps Hanoi close to Moscow and is used as an argument to keep Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. Some Americans note the long historical record of Vietnam's trying to expand into Cambodia.  But Vietnamese officials see two ways out: building up their allied Cambodian forces until they are able to of maintain a pro-Vietnamese regime in power, or arriving at some political solution involving the Cambodian anti-Vietnamese guerrillas that would permit Vietnamese withdrawal before 1990, when Hanoi has said its troops will depart.  For the moment, at least, this has frozen the Vietnamese-American relationship.  ''They will only withdraw,'' Mr. Armitage insisted, ''if they have succeeded in their plan to suborn Khmer culture. I don't think that's possible. They tried that in the 1800's.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 2 1986 ,2
"    The United States and Vietnam do not agree about much, but Hanoi has evidently accepted Washington's insistence that it must cooperate in accounting for the 1,797 Americans listed as missing in the war that ended in 1975. This week, the most senior United States officials to visit Hanoi in eight years are to meet with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thac to lay the groundwork for closing the books.  The Vietnamese ''have evidenced greater cooperation on this issue'' of late, said Richard L. Armitage, an Assistant Secretary of Defense.  He will be accompanied to Hanoi by Assistant Secretary of State Paul D. Wolfowitz; Richard Childress, a senior National Securitry Council aide, and Anne Mills Griffith of the League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. Mr. Childress and Mrs. Griffith went to Vietnam in September for talks that the State Department said had been the ''most positive'' to date.  In November, Americans and Vietnamese searched a site near Hanoi where a B-52 bomber crashed in 1972. However, bone fragments that they unearthed are believed unlikely to help identify missing Americans.  Vietnam has said it wants to clear up the issue of the missing, presumably to pave the way for diplomatic relations with Washington and to mitigate its dependence on the Soviet Union, which provides $1 billion a year in aid.  Washington, however, insists that relations cannot begin until the estimated 140,000 Vietnamese soldiers occupying Cambodia are removed.

"   , Vietnam, Tuesday, Jan. 7   Two days of high-level talks between the United States and Vietnam on the issue of Americans missing in action from the Vietnam War ended today with both sides expressing satisfaction with negotiations but calling for quicker progress on unresolved cases.  It was announced that a round of technical discussions would take place late next month to consider what the Vietnamese described as 50 new reports of remains. The two sides also talked about the opening of an American technical office here but decided such a move was unnecessary at this point, according to the American side.  The United States delegation, the highest to come to Vietnam since the war, was led by Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, who spoke to reporters after the final session today. He was joined at the news conference by Hoang Bich Son, the Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister, who headed Hanoi's delegation.  Meeting With Foreign Minister  The Americans met earlier this morning with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach. Mr. Thach, leaving the Foreign Ministry guest house, a former French colonial governor's palace, said that while both sides were pleased with the discussions, they sought quicker progress.  Mr. Son said later that a two-year timetable for resolving the question of missing Americans, which Vietnam announced in July, would now go into effect. But he and Mr. Thach said they hoped the issue could be resolved in less than two years.  The United States has made a fuller accounting of missing Americans a prerequisite for better relations with Vietnam. A total of 1,797 Americans are unaccounted for in Vietnam and around its shores.  Talks on Prisoners of War  While the United States has largely agreed with Vietnam that there is almost no likelihood that any missing Americans are still alive, there have been repeated reports in the United States of evidence that some Americans are being held prisoner.  The issue of prisoners of war was raised this morning, according to Foreign Minister Thach. ''I have assured them that there is no one alive in our hands,'' he said.  Officials said the atmosphere around the talks had been businesslike and devoid of ceremony.  Over the last year both the Vietnamese and the Reagan Administration have said they have been encouraged by progress on the issue of the missing Americans. In July the Vietnamese returned the remains of 26 Americans killed during the war, most of them downed airmen.  In November Hanoi allowed the first joint excavation of an American B-52 crash site near Hanoi.  The United States delegation at the talks here included Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs; Richard K. Childress of the National Security Council, and Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families, which represents the relatives of missing Americans.  Also in the delegation were Col. Howard Hill of the Defense Department and M. Lyall Breckon, director of the State Department's Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia section.  The Vietnamese Delegates  The Vietnamese delegation included Mr. Son; Nguyen Dy Nien, an Assistant Foreign Minister; Tran Hoan, director of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's North American Department, and Nguyen Can, the Deputy Director of North American Affairs.  The United States had insisted that the meeting be confined to the issue of missing Americans. The Vietnamese sought to broaden the discussions to other issues holding up American diplomatic recognition of Hanoi.  Washington has said there will be no diplomatic relations or economic help until Vietnamese troops leave Cambodia. Hanoi toppled the Khmer Rouge Government there seven years ago today and now occupies the country with more than 150,000 troops.  Hanoi is openly acknowledging that it would like to link the opening of any American liaison office in Hanoi with the opening of a Vietnamese mission in Washington.  Hanoi Seeks Warmer Ties  On Saturday, Vo Dong Giang, a Minister of State at the Vietnamese Foreign Office, told reporters that it was only fair that if the Americans were present in Hanoi, the Vietnamese should be present in Washington.  Asian officials and diplomats based in Hanoi said the Vietnamese attached great importance to the meeting with the Americans because Hanoi needed to improve relations with Washington for several reasons.  Diplomats describe the Vietnamese leadership as uncomfortable in an exclusive alliance with the Soviet Union.  The Vietnamese, they say, would like to be able to play Washington and Moscow off against each other in the region, where both Soviet and American strategic interests are at stake.  Vietnam would also like warmer relations with China, which would give Hanoi even more leverage in dealing with the great powers, diplomats say.  Reconstruction Is Aim  In a meeting with reporters on Monday while the first session of the talks was in progress, Mr. Giang, the Minister of State, was asked why Vietnam wanted better relations with Washington. ''We do not want to improve relations only with Washington,'' he said. ''We want to improve relations with all the people around us because we need a peaceful framework for reconstruction.''  There are those close to Hanoi who contend that Vietnam, now one of the world's poorest countries, continues to hold out hope for some kind of American reparations for the war or at least for American help in development.  But even without recompense, Vietnam appears to believe that it would gain substantially from United States recognition in terms of unofficial aid from American and international organizations. A number of private American humanitarian organizations say they would like to aid the Vietnamese but have been blocked by the diplomatic situation.

"   , Vietnam   ''You Americans have given the world a false impression of Vietnam,'' a European with long experience in Indochina said last week, just before Hanoi welcomed the highest-level United States delegation to visit Vietnam since the war ended. ''These people are not giants.'' The theme is repeated by diplomats, aid officials, scholars and the few business representatives who somehow manage to trade with Vietnam. The country they describe is not the vanquisher of two large Western armies or the conqueror of Pol Pot. It is a very poor, chronically undernourished, badly administered nation riven by ministerial rivalries in the capital and gestures of defiance in the provinces, whose authorities hew to the old Vietnamese adage that ''the power of the emperor stops at the village gate.''  Foreigners from East and West not party to the affair say they are fascinated if not mystified by the emotional links that persist between the Vietnamese and Americans. For the Vietnamese, the focus on the United States, where friends and family of many live, is constant. To Americans, Vietnam might be just another poor third world country clamoring for attention - except for the war, and those who never came back.  In American perceptions, Hanoi remains a threat to all of Southeast Asia because of its overthrow seven years ago of Pol Pot's Government in Cambodia and its domination of Laos, which have angered and frightened Vietnam's other neighbors. The Reagan Administration has said it will not recognize Hanoi until Vietnamese troops leave Cambodia.  Yet the Vietnamese need all that American diplomatic recognition can offer. They hope for, among other things, the relaxation of a Western and Japanese aid embargo, a way out of increasingly unproductive economic dependence on Moscow and help in manuevering China into a Cambodian settlement. For aid, at least, time is short - the average weight of a Vietnamese citizen is dropping at the rate of a pound or two a year, international health officials say, and the country is nearly bereft of medicines except for supplies sent by relatives abroad. Last week, Vietnamese officials were acknowledging that a decade after uniting the country under socialism, Hanoi has been unable to suppress the private traders who still manipulate the vital rice market.  'Mutual Benefit'  But, out of pride and ideological orthodoxy, Vietnamese leaders almost always refer to the country as ''reconstructing'' rather than ''developing.'' And they insist that diplomatic relations with Washington would be ''of mutual benefit.''  Foreigners who live in Hanoi say that, while the Vietnamese people may be secretive or uncommunicative, they are neither inherently militaristic nor highly disciplined, as they have been portrayed in the West -except in the army. The remarkable self-sacrifice that sustained a 30-year fight for independence, diplomats and some Vietnamese civilians suggest, is not translating easily into dying for Cambodians in a new war categorized here as ''implementing an international obligation.''  On their side of the funhouse mirror, many Vietnamese cling to some stereotypical pictures of Americans. ''Americans are stingy and selfish; they do not pay attention to the sufferings of other people,'' Hong Ha, the editor of the Communist party newspaper and a member of the party's central committee, said last week. His remark, which he said reflected letters the newspaper received from readers, referred to the well-publicized American failure to offer aid to Vietnam last fall after tropical storms left crops ruined and hundreds of thousands of people homeless.  The Vietnamese also resent Washington's insistence that their country account for nearly 1,800 missing American servicemen, or M.I.A.'s, a small fraction of the number of Vietnamese still unaccounted for in their own land.  War Reparations  Mr. Ha gave this illustration: ''One of our readers sent us a letter asking: The Americans staged a war that caused a lot of difficulties for our country. Why should we let them come to Vietnam to look for the wreckage of their planes when they have not fulfilled their responsibilities to the Vietnamese people?''  The reader was referring to war reparations, a hope being raised again in official circles as talks between Hanoi and Washington are making progress.  Sensing movement, Vietnamese leaders seem to be adding for immediate consideration elements not previously on the agenda.  During two days of talks last week, the Vietnamese offered to start the clock on a two-year deadline for resolving the issue of Americans missing in action and to investigate reports that the remains of 50 Americans have been found in the countryside. Technical discussions will be conducted in late February.  For itself, Vietnam now wants an office in Washington or another American city such as Philadelphia, according to some reports. While the Vietnamese have suggested an American technical office in Hanoi, which would coordinate searches for the wreckage of American planes, United States officials have been reluctant because such an office might be portrayed by Hanoi as a diplomatic presence. Vietnam's new demand strikes some diplomats here as a something of a justification for United States apprehension.  ''One of the good things about Vietnam,'' a European said, ''is that you can always be frank. So I asked my Vietnamese friends: How many M.I.A.'s do you have in America that you should have an office there?''  TEN YEARS OF TALK ON MISSING AMERICANS  Vietnamese and American officials have met sporadically over the last 10 years, with a long hiatus after Vietnam's incursion into Cambodia, to discuss the fate of missing Americans and other obstacles to establishing normal relations. Here are some of the major meetings:  November 1976 United States and Vietnamese diplomats meet in Paris in the first formal talks since the war; no progress is reported, and three days later the United States vetoes Vietnam's United Nations membership application.  March 1977  President Carter sends a delegation to Hanoi; Vietnam turns over the remains of 12 American pilots and proposes a new round of talks.  May-June 1977  A United States delegation holds more talks with the Vietnamese in Paris about normalization of relations.  August 1978  A delegation led by Senator Edward M. Kennedy discusses humanitarian issues with officials in Hanoi, then leaves with 29 Vietnamese, the first to be reunited with American husbands and fathers.  July 1985  A United States-sponsored research group spends three days in Hanoi; Vietnam promises to return remains of 26 American servicemen.  August 1985  At a meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam proposes a two-year timetable for resolving the fate of missing Americans.  November 1985  A United States military delegation spends 13 days with a Vietnamese team excavating a site where a B-52 crashed in 1972.

"   , Thailand, Jan. 12   While American and Vietnamese officials expressed satisfaction last week with the atmosphere of good will surrounding two days of high-level talks in Hanoi on Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War, both sides agreed that they had reached a time when building confidence and increasing cooperation would be critical.  Material progress will have to be made, they said, if the issue of the missing is no longer to prevent better relations between the two countries.  There are potential problems on both sides, officials said, and the wide attention paid to the negotiations, which produced no breakthroughs, could sharpen divisions.  Wants U.S. to 'Leave Us Alone'  Not all Vietnamese leaders favor cooperation with the United States.  Asked by reporters last Monday what he most wanted from Washington, Vo Dong Giang, the second-highest ranking official in the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, said, ''We would like the U.S. to leave us alone and stop assisting China in the latter's efforts to undermine us.''  During the talks last week, it became clear, officials said, that the Vietnamese had rejected American proposals made last summer for a joint plan of action on the missing.  The Vietnamese, apparently unwilling to share too much information related to their own national security, did pledge, however, to begin this month their own two-year program to account for as many Americans as possible. Anti-American language has been absent from public pronouncements.  The leader of the Vietnamese delegation, Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son, said in a meeting with reporters at the end of the discussions that Hanoi had already begun an ''educational campaign'' in the countryside that had produced 50 new reports of possible American war dead. He said the reports would be presented to an American-Vietnamese technical meeting in Hanoi at the end of February.  U.S. Show of Good Will  Hanoi has said publicly that the Vietnamese people could not be persuaded to help look for missing Americans until the United States showed more good will toward Vietnam.  The United States Defense Department, which lists 1,797 American soldiers and civilians unaccounted for in Vietnam or off its coasts, promised in return to assist Hanoi with information or equipment needed for searches.  On their side, the Americans have to contend with what they call the ''Rambo factor'' in the United States. United States officials said private crusades, often couched in what they termed a crude anti-Communism that diplomats and American military officers dealing with the issue of the war-dead say they abhor, threatened to undermine years of low-key efforts that seem ready to produce results.  Diplomats in Hanoi said repeated private assertions by Americans that Hanoi is still holding, possibly under conditions of extreme deprivation or even torture, scores of Americans on the missing list were particularly rankling to the Vietnamese.  Possibility Not Ruled Out  United States officials said they were not ruling out the possibility that some of the missing Americans might still be alive in Vietnam. But American officials said they were seeking ways to allow the Vietnamese to save face in acounting for any such Americans.  European diplomats in Hanoi who regularly check reports of sightings of Americans are virtually unanimous in doubting that there are many, if any, prisoners held by Vietnam. But they said the chances were good that there were some deserters living in Vietnamese villages.  Diplomatic ways are also being sought to recover war dead that most Americans close to the issue say they believe are already in the possession of the Vietnamese.  Asian diplomats said it would be extremely embarrassing for Hanoi to be seen in the eyes of the world as having hoarded American bodies more than a decade after the war for future trade-offs.  ''We are Asians, too, and we know how they think,'' an Indonesian said. ''The Vietnamese now understand that they have dissipated the good will they had in the developing world with their occupation of Cambodia. They can't get away with using these bodies as poker chips.''  A Humanitarian Issue  Both sides have been working hard to live up to their assertions that the issue of the missing is a strictly humanitarian one and that it will not be used in the negotiations as a bargaining ploy or a means of scoring political points.  It has long been assumed by regional diplomats and officials that Hanoi would benefit most from a resolution of the issue, as Vietnam needs Western technical assistance and help in resolving the seven-year-old war in Cambodia.  Lately, however, diplomats in Hanoi have been questioning whether the seemingly deteriorating security situation in the Philippines might not be causing the United States to look more closely again at mainland Southeast Asia.  Although diplomats say Vietnam is not likely to be persuaded to eject a large Soviet military presence, as Egypt once did, Hanoi is thought to want more balanced international relationships.  ''They don't want to be another tropical fruit farm for Moscow - like Cuba,'' a European with experience in assisting the Vietnamese said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 12 1986 ,2

The officials, Assistant Defense Secretary Richard L. Armitage and Assistant Secretary of State Paul D.

''We have been unable thus far to prove that any Americans are being held against their will,'' Mr. Armitage said at a news conference.

"   , Vietnam   In the cold of winter Hanoi is often silent after sundown, with little more than the ring of bicycle bells or the clang of a streetcar to compete with the muffled conversations or coughing of unseen people in dark courtyards.  At night the old street lamps are kind to the city, powdering its aging but still beautiful face with a golden glow. Life moves indoors: to theaters, movie houses, video or dance clubs, coffee bars and small restaurants hidden from view at the tops of stairs off passageways between narrow houses.  While the Vietnamese are able to find all kinds of evening entertainment, foreigners who live here sometimes complain that the secrecy of Vietnamese life seems to extend to a reluctance to advertise its cultural joys.  The Talk of the Season  One recent night at Hanoi's new culture center, a Kennedy Center-style complex built with Soviet help, people were being turned away from the season's most talked-about production because it was sold out.  The musical play tells the story of an Amerasian boy abandoned by his rich South Vietnamese mother because he is black - abandoned, that is, for 13 years, until she finds that he, the son of an affair with ''Charles Smith,'' could be her ticket to the United States.  The play, titled ''Doi Dong Sua Me,'' or, roughly translated, ''Two Streams of Mother's Milk,'' is a tear-jerker; a foreigner who asked to see it was warned by an interpreter that it would be ''very emotional.'' The sniffles of the audience of 1,200 (plus five in armchairs in the aisle and some children on laps) proved him right.  The Amerasian boy, played by a Vietnamese actor in minstrel blackface and curly wig, was dropped into the cradle of a saintly village teacher and her understanding husband, whose own baby, a girl, is taken away by the influential Saigon colonel's wife. As the play gets under way, the boy is entering his teens and does not want to leave his village ''mother.''  'Where Should I Go Now?'  ''Who am I?'' he cries when told he is really the son of an American soldier and a city lady in silk and jewels he does not recognize. ''Where should I go now?''  For a stranger to Vietnam's long process of building trust and understanding between north and south, the play is fascinating. Its South Vietnamese setting and style allow for lavish costumes, beautifully made up women and dapper men in leisure suits, Panama hats and sunglasses.  ''You must be from Saigon'' is a line that brings down the house. The audience seems to enjoy not only the sights but also the southern Vietnamese songs that punctuate the drama. There is a live band in the wings.  But the play is also full of subtle messages. The southerners, if buffoons, are not entirely evil. ''After re-education, I feel better about the humanitarian policy of the new regime,'' the former colonel says.  No Wallflowers  There are other interesting things to see and do in Hanoi - if the visitor can find them. Only the Saturday ''Soiree de Danse'' at the Boho Hotel got the benefit of a poster recently at the nearby Thong Nhat, where most foreigners stay or live.  The gathering turned out to be a disco ''with the exuberance of a village hop,'' a British visitor said. There were plenty of beer bottles, and no wallflowers. Some of the lively young women, Western guests reported, were offering more than just a partner for a tango.  Where does everyone learn to dance so well? ''Our youth clubs are teaching it,'' a Government guide explained. ''Dancing is very popular now.''  Not far away, at the French-built opera house, the curtain had just come down on a performance of ''Swan Lake'' by a new Russian-inspired Vietnamese ballet corps.  A ticket for a four-seat box (with its velvet rail intact) went for less than 50 cents. There was no program; a woman in a snow white ao dai stepped forward to read a synopsis of the plot - and the names of all the dancers and musicians - from several pieces of paper that shook in her hands.  Enthusiasm and Grace  The orchestra may have attacked the Tchaikovsky overture as if it had been written by Mahler, and the piano needed tuning. But the young dancers, faced with a house more than half empty, performed their task with enthusiasm and grace.  At a lull in the music the voice of a large man whom a visitor took to be an Eastern European talent scout rose from a front-row mezzanine seat. ''I must emphasize that if we do the cultural exchange,'' he said in English to his Vietnamese hosts, ''they must absolutely stay for two full years.''  At intermission, there was a jarring note from the world outside. A couple of visitors who tried to stroll on the plaza in front of the opera house found all the doors of the building closed and padlocked.  ''It's the Chinese,'' a guard said mysteriously. ''We are afraid of Chinese mines. You know several years ago they put explosives in cinemas. We can't take chances here.'' Crab Soup and Frog Legs Before or after an evening's entertainment, the place to go for an exceptional meal in Hanoi, where hotel food is unimaginative, is to one of the tiny backstreet private restaurants. There, in a setting that often approaches medieval squalor, the most primitive of kitchens can turn out crab soup, or frog legs, pepper steak or seafood rushed in from Haiphong.  The cooking is European. Because of the high price of meals - the ingredients are the best the private market has to offer - most of the diners are foreigners.  Often half the fun is seeing who is dining out where. There might be Russians who burst into robust singing after a few rounds of vodka. Or a visiting television crew from Tokyo with its own chest of ice-cold beer.  One recent evening, a climb to a two-room boite with only two tables brought a customer face to face with the French Ambassador, Ivan Bastouil, in elegant brown velvet, presiding over a party of diplomatic guests.

"    Senator Frank H. Murkowski went to Vietnam to find out about Americans missing in action in the Indochina war, but left today with two Vietnamese children who were separated from their mother seven years ago.  Senator Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, led a Congressional delegation to Hanoi to urge the Vietnamese to help resolve the cases of Americans who remain listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War.  The delegation left today after Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, told them no that Americans were being held against their will.  But the lawmaker was accompanied by Nguyen Vu Chinh, 10 years old, and Tran Thanh Quynh, 9. The two chidlren are to rejoin their mother in Alaska on Tuesday.  Mother Lives in Fairbanks  Their mother, Xuan Thi Nguyen, fled to the United States seven years ago and now lives in Fairbanks. She had asked the Senator's office to help get her children out of Vietnam.  ''I'm just very emotionally moved at the sight of those two kids here with us on the way to a new life,'' said Senator Murkowski, chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.  ''I'm so pleased and so humbled that we can bring them to their mother, that they will have the opportunity that we enjoy living in America.''  The chidlren were accompanied from Ho Chi Minh city by their aunt, Nguyen Thi Sau, 30, who raised them in their hometown of Tay Ninh after their mother left.  Senator Murkowski said last-minute red tape threatened to stall the exchange when low-ranking officials questioned whether the children's paperwork was complete.  He said that at that point, Mr. Thach leaned over to him and said, ''Just go.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  SERIES: HANOI, Vietnam, Jan. 18 (AP) -                      ",January 17 1986 ,0
"   , Laos, Jan. 19   A United States Congressional delegation said today that Laotian officials had rejected an appeal to allow Americans to enter Laos to help investigate possible sightings of American soldiers.  The four-member delegation reported that although the parting toasts were cordial, the talks had produced little new information on the fate of 556 Americans still listed as missing in action in Laos during the Vietnam War.  The four lawmakers, representing the Veterans Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, met for two hours with Soubanh Sritthirath, the Deputy Foreign Minister, and then for less than an hour with Foreign Minister Phoun Sipaseut.  The delegation was concluding a trip to the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. It was led by Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who is chairman of the Senate committee, and included Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona; Representative Bob McEwen, Republican of Ohio, and Representative Michael Bilirakis, Republican of Florida. #95 Sightings Still Stand Since the war ended in 1975, 806 ''live sightings'' of Americans in Indochina have been reported, mostly by refugees, according to United States Government records. Investigations have ruled out the possibility of living Americans in all but 95 reports, including 13 in Laos, United States officials say.  A total of 2,441 Americans are still listed as missing in action in the Indochina conflict - 556 of them in Laos, 88 in Cambodia and 1,797 in Vietnam.  Senator Murkowski said he and his colleagues had pressed the Laotians to allow independent verification of their position that no missing Americans are alive in Laos.  Senator DeConcini said he had asked that the United States be allowed to send observers with Laotian teams to the area of the sightings in Laos. Foreign Minister Phoun Sipaseut refused.  Mr. McEwen proposed that an international team from the Red Cross or the United Nations accompany Laotian searchers, but he said the Foreign Minister had bristled at the idea.  Laos Reports Wide Census  Senator Murkowski said he had suggested to the Foreign Minister that some Americans might be living in Laos but ''not in your control.''  He quoted Mr. Phoun Sipaseut as saying that his Government had conducted an extensive national census last year that found no Americans, and that notices had been distributed throughout Laos asking people for information on Americans.  ''The minister told us three times, 'There are absolutely none,' '' Senator Murkowski said.  On Saturday, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam pledged that any of the lawmakers could personally investigate any reported live sighting in Vietnam, but he said Vietnam was not holding any Americans.  Senator DeConcini said he planned to follow up on the offer. Bringing Two Children to U.S. The Congressional delegation returned today to Bangkok, Thailand, and plans to head back to Washington on Tuesday by way of Anchorage.  Two Vietnamese children will be aboard their Air Force C-135 jetliner. Acting on Senator Murkowski's appeal, Vietnam released Nguyen Van Chinh, a 10-year-old boy, and Tran Thanh Quynh, a 9-year-old girl, so they could be reunited with their mother, whom they have not seen in seven years.  Their mother, Xuan Thi Nguyen, 35, is now married to an American aircraft mechanic in Fairbanks, Alaska.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 19 1986 ,2

"    When Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska brought two Vietnamese children from Hanoi to Washington to reunite them with their parents after seven years, his staff thought a touch of home would make Nguyen Vu Chinh, the 10-year-old boy, and Tran Thanh Quynh Chi, his 9-year-old sister, feel better in a strange and confusing land. So a call went out Monday from Capitol Hill to Germaine's restaurant, whose proprietor is Vietnamese.  The same evening, some of the Senator's staff took the children and their parents, William Uhlig and Xuan Thi Nguyen, to the restaurant just north of Georgetown, to find that Germaine Swanson had run up a special repast of shrimp sour soup, spring roll, lemon grass chicken, rice noodles with barbecued pork, fried grouper with fried ginger and fish sauce and beef sauteed with vegetables. Between courses, the children practiced saying ''We are glad to meet you'' for a visit to the White House the next day, after which the family flew home to Fairbanks.

"   , Thailand, Feb. 15   A group of American members of Congress said today that Vietnamese officials had acknowledged for the first time that missing Americans might be living inside Vietnam, in remote areas not under full Government control.  They said Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son had told them that three Vietnamese teams were investigating reported sightings of Americans and had invited the United States to take part.  The members of Congress, who came here after two days in the Vietnamese capital, said Vietnamese officials also promised to return the bodies of 14 more Americans missing in action from the Vietnam War and had increased to 70 the number of missing on whom they promised reports.  ''For the first time, the Vietnamese Government is investigating a large number of live sightings,'' said Representative Gerald B. Solomon, Republican of Upstate New York, who is leading the nine-member House of Representatives task force on missing Americans and prisoners of war in Southeast Asia.  Hanoi's Position Is Modified  ''For years, Vietnam maintained that no live Americans were in Vietnam,'' he said at a news conference. ''They later changed that to say there were no live Americans under their control. But now they have moved to the position where they say that there could be live Americans that they are unaware of.''  Mr. Solomon, who met for three hours with Mr. Hoang, said the Foreign Minister had stressed that Vietnam was not holding any Americans against their will.  Another delegation member, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of Upstate New York, said the Vietnamese had indicated that there might be Americans living in the mountains or other remote areas not under full Government control.  Representative Solomon said, ''They have invited the U.S. Government as well to participate in any of these investigations, and I think that is most significant.'' #2,441 on Missing List A total of 2,441 Americans are listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War, including 1,797 missing in Vietnam and the rest in Laos and Cambodia.  Since the United States withdrew its military forces from Indochina in 1973, there have been 806 reported ''live sightings'' of Americans in the region, most by refugees, according to Federal Government records. Federal officials say they have discounted all but 95 reports.  Representative Bob Dornan, Republican of California, said he believed Vietnam might be holding Americans to make use of their technical knowledge.  Representative Bill Hendon, Republican of North Carolina, said there was a '''great deal'' of intelligence information indicating that Americans remained in remote areas of Vietnam, but he did not elaborate.  Vietnam said early last month that it had collected about 50 new reports of missing Americans and would turn them over soon. The Congressmen said Hanoi officials have promised to hand over information on 20 additional cases, for a total of about 70.  Meanwhile, Mr. Dornan announced that the bodies of eight American servicemen recently returned by the Vietnamese have been identified by the United States Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii, the military organization responsible for resolving cases of the missing. ---- No U.S. Comment on Sightings WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 - A State Department spokesman said today that there would be no comment on the findings of the Congressional delegation.  ''The U.S. has investigated every report of live sightings of Americans,'' the spokesman said. ''So far we have not been able to prove that Americans prisoners of war remain in Indochina. We cannot rule out the possibility that there are live American prisoners there, however. So we proceed on the assumption that some Americans may be held.''

"   , Vietnam   After years of hesitancy and disagreement within the Vietnamese Communist Party, Hanoi now appears to be committed to major reforms in almost every area of the nation's economic life.  ''We consider this a revolution in our country,'' Hong Ha, the editor of the People's Daily, the party newspaper, said in a recent interview. In a strongly worded New Year's Day editorial, the People's Daily cited ''many errors and shortcomings'' in the country's economic management, and said there were a ''string of burning problems'' that had to be tackled this year.  The task will be a large one. With a per capita income of between $120 and $160, according to the best international estimates, Vietnam ranks among the world's poorest nations, falling steadily behind most of its Asian neighbors.  Mr. Ha, a youthful-looking 57-year-old party central committee member who was wearing a stylish cavalry twill suit, pastel shirt and fashionable woolen tie when he met reporters in his well-furnished office, said that the increased production of consumer goods - including textiles, paper and bicycle parts - would be one of this year's economic priorities.  Peasants Need Materials  ''The peasants are also demanding building materials,'' he added.  But more fundamental than what Vietnam hopes to produce, Mr. Ha said, was how this production would be carried out. He said the country needed new economic management to monitor cost effectiveness, productivity and quality control.  Woefully inadequate communcation and transportation systems, an absence of reliable statistics, unworkable and discouraging investment practices and even the country's tight security net would have to be reassessed, he said.  ''We have to be more dynamic,'' he said.  The Communists' Sixth Party Congress, called for the end of this year, will have to endorse changes, pressed by the country's chief planner, Vo Van Kiet, to make them official. But already there are sure signs that the measures are being taken seriously.  Several Western reporters who recently visited Hanoi and toured the countryside - where some agricultural reforms are already being tested - heard officials and farmers alike using phrases such as ''cost analysis,'' ''streamlined labor forces'' and ''consumer demand.'' But with one eye on the party hardliners, they also talk about ''socialist accounting'' and describe saving money as a ''revolutionary activity.''  The Vietnamese say their models - particularly for incentive systems and encouraging private initiative -are Moscow, Hungary or East Germany, noting that many young Vietnamese work, or are educated, in Soviet bloc countries.  Watching Peking  Foreign diplomats here say Hanoi has been watching Peking's progress very carefully. Just as in China, the Vietnamese say, farmers here are beginning to improve their lives at a rate unknown to city dwellers. Under a five-year-old experimental ''contract'' system of farming, production of foodstuffs over an agreed amount can be disposed of by the individual farmer or his cooperative.  Reporters visiting a cooperative farm in Hai Hung province were told how each farmer is also entitled to grow crops of his choosing on 5 percent of the land he works for the cooperative. Produce and meat from private plots is sold at busy markets in rural towns. In variety and freshness of food, a meal in the countryside beats anything Hanoi's best hotels can offer.  Vietnam's planners have also been watching the trade patterns of Southeast Asia's prosperous non-Communist neighbors, as some of these countries - Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand in particular -find their overseas markets shrinking in a slower world economy.  Regional Trade  Hanoi - or more often Ho Chi Minh City, the former South Vietnamese capital of Saigon, which retains some economic independence - has been having some success at increasing trade with regional countries looking for new markets, despite an official boycott linked to Vietnam's continued occupation of Cambodia.  Recent figures from the Thai Farmers' Bank, one of Thailand's leading financial institutions, show that Singapore's business community had almost doubled trade with Vietnam between 1980 and 1984, from $67 million to $120 million. And an air cargo service was recently started between the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City.  There is no way to measure the additional income in smuggled goods. Many of the luxury items that find their way to Hanoi come from Bangkok or Singapore. Imported beer and whisky found in hotels catering to foreigners frequently bear the label ''Singapore duty not paid.''  The Japanese, whose Government also professes to follow an official embargo on aid, recently held a trade fair in Ho Chi Minh City for 18 private companies. The companies selling what one diplomat here described as exactly the kind of machinery the Vietnamese need in this stage of development: rice-harvesting equipment, small hydro units and power generators and other simple, but critical, technology.  Japanese Seek Longer Stay  Japanese businessmen, who now get three-to-six-month visas from Hanoi, are hoping to be able to move in permanently next year, a diplomat said.  Vietnam's biggest drawbacks to increased trade, diplomats say, include its lack of hard-currency reserves to pay for imports or buy needed technology, a poor transportation system and what one foreign resident of Hanoi decribed as ''no sense at all of how to make a profit.''  ''What Vietnam has not got,'' this European said, ''is a cadre of highly educated, free-market economists -usually American trained - like those who have guided development in the rest of Asia.''

"    For the first time in years, a Defense Department investigation has found that Vietnam may indeed still hold American prisoners of war. At least that is the assessment of Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe Jr., a former Director of Defense Intelligence who headed a five-month review of intelligence files on the issue. The general said last week that ''a large volume of evidence'' - mainly ''live sightings'' reported by Vietnamese refugees - points to the likelihood that Americans are still imprisoned by Hanoi.  But the current Director of Defense Intelligence was more cautious. At a news conference a day after General Tighe's remarks, Lieut. Gen. Leonard H. Perroots contended that, while the investigation pointed to the ''strong possibility'' that some Americans remain alive in Vietnam 14 years after the United States pulled out, there was no ''strong compelling evidence'' to prove it. And General Perroots, who appointed the investigative panel, refused to speculate on whether Hanoi still holds Americans prisoner or whether Americans had voluntarily remained in Southeast Asia.  Veterans' groups and families of the missing have argued that Washington has not done enough to find out what happened to the 2,430 Americans who remain unaccounted for in Indochina. Although the Vietnamese Government has repeatedly denied holding prisoners, it said earlier this year that Americans may be living in remote parts of the country.  The Pentagon announced late last week that American and Vietnamese officials would meet in Hanoi this week to talk about the missing Americans. It will be the fourth such conference this year and the eighth since the Vietnamese agreed in March 1985 to discuss the issue.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",October 5 1986 ,2
"    BITTER VICTORY By Robert Shaplen. 309 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $16.95.  ROBERT SHAPLEN came to Indochina sooner than most of us, and he has stayed with it longer than most of us, too. He first visited Saigon in 1946 for Newsweek magazine; he was among the last Americans to leave the city in 1975, with the Communists at its gates; and he was permitted by the authorities in Hanoi to spend five weeks traveling in Vietnam and a week traveling in Cambodia in the autumn of 1984. ''Bitter Victory'' is an account of what he saw and heard on that journey, reporting for The New Yorker, as well as an analysis of the complex political and economic situation in Southeast Asia. It is enriched by the kind of perspective that few writers and even fewer policy makers can bring to the subject.  In Ho Chi Minh City, as Saigon is now known, Mr. Shaplen encountered numberless Amerasian youngsters, many of them teen-agers, who were ostracized by the Vietnamese. Under the present quota approved by the United States of only 250 a month, it will take more than a decade for all of these children of Vietnamese mothers and American fathers to reach the United States. North of the capital, Mr. Shaplen visited the area that we used to call the Iron Triangle because it was so strongly fortified. (It was there, on Christmas Day, 1966, that Bob Hope entertained troops of the United States 25th Infantry Division while directly beneath him, in the tunnels that underlay the entire district, a Vietnamese singer entertained enemy guerrilla units.) Local officials told how they foiled each new American effort to uncover the tunnels, using pepper, for example, to drive away the dogs the G.I.'s used. And in Danang, the old Marine base in central Vietnam, which had shrunk to half its wartime size, Mr. Shaplen made the somehow pleasing discovery (to me, anyway) that our ramshackle press camp has been turned into a shrimp cannery.  It was in Hanoi, however, that Mr. Shaplen's trip paid its richest rewards, for he was able to talk at length not only to Le Duc Tho, the number two man in the party hierarchy - who told him that he was the first American he had met since concluding his negotiations with Henry Kissinger in Paris in 1972 - but also to a number of other Vietnamese who had played key roles during and since the war. On the basis of those conversations, the author concluded that the leadership in Hanoi has decided it must wind down the war in Cambodia if it is to achieve what he terms its two greatest goals - a rapprochement with the United States that would lessen the country's almost total dependence on the Soviet Union, and an easing of tensions with China. He also concluded that the precarious economic and social situation the Vietnamese find themselves in, a decade after the end of the war, is mostly their own fault, the result of what he terms ''a crippling inability to create unity among themselves and to reach out to others, including their neighbors in Southeast Asia, in a spirit of friendship and compromise.'' More than anything else, Mr. Shaplen argues, it is Hanoi's failure to adjust to postwar reality that has doomed the Vietnamese to the abysmal poverty they also knew 10 and 20 and 30 years ago, despite all their sacrifices during the last 40 years and all the potential riches of their country.  Yet despite his title, Mr. Shaplen also sees scattered signs of hope. The (temporary?) ascendancy of the pragmatists over the ideologues in the Vietnamese Politburo, he thinks, offers at least a chance of resolving the conflict between the ''soft'' south and ''hard'' north, and perhaps even of evolving a variant of socialism as well adapted to the individualism of the Vietnamese as the Kadar version is to the energy and acquisitiveness of the Hungarians. He is too optimistic; by this spring, inflation was once again rampant, pork and rice were scarce and industry was running at less than half capacity because of energy shortages. MUCH the most gripping part of a book that sometimes loses its way in the fogs of diplomatic speculation, especially where Cambodia is concerned, deals with the Vietnamese view of the war against the Americans. It is fascinating, for example, that the senior military historian in Hanoi argues that the two key battles in that conflict took place before the arrival of the first United States combat units in 1965; and it is stirring, whatever one's attitude to the war, to read of the sustained heroism that made possible the construction, expansion and operation of the Ho Chi Minh trail. The details are awesome: 30,000 men at work on the trail at its busiest, 10,000 tons of freight carried every week, thousands of miles of roadway completely covered by trees and vines braided to form a canopy. Without the trail, the Vietnamese say, they would have lost.  The generals to whom Mr. Shaplen talked all but admitted that, as the American command contended at the time, they suffered disproportionate and temporarily crippling losses in the 1968 Tet offensive, but they considered them acceptable because of the political victory represented by President Johnson's subsequent decision to leave office.  Mr. Shaplen for the most part dismisses the revisionist view that earlier or bolder attacks on Cambodia or Hanoi or the Ho Chi Minh trail might have changed the outcome of the war. His most telling witness is retired Maj. Gen. Dinh Duc Thien, the wartime North Vietnamese logistics chief, who is quoted as having told the author: ''Even if you had destroyed Hanoi, bombed it flat, we would still have gone into the countryside. . . . An industrial country cannot defeat an agricultural nation by bombing.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo of Robert Shaplen  TYPE: Review                      ",October 5 1986 ,0

"   , Thailand, Oct. 25   Hanoi's new Communist Party leader, in a series of tough speeches over the last week setting the agenda for a party congress, is portraying Vietnam as a troubled country that has squandered its material and human potential through its own mistakes.  In speeches to preliminary party meetings held by the army and the City of Hanoi, the party leader, Truong Chinh, who replaced Le Duan as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam in July, attacked economic policy and described in harsh terms the consequent problems of corruption, unemployment and a dispirited and deprived population.  ''Prices fluctuate wildly, and life is unstable,'' he was reported to have said last Sunday. ''Negativism has developed, traditional ethical and spiritual values are eroded and socioeconomic activities are thrown into prolonged chaos, causing widespread doubt about the future and a lack of confidence in the party's leadership.''  He told his audience that these were matters to consider at a party conference that Vietnamese officials have suggested will be held around the end of the year, although no date has been announced.  Excerpts from the speeches have been repeatedly broadcast all week by the Hanoi radio, in English for foreign audiences and in full-text Vietnamese versions for domestic listeners.  The remarks by Mr. Chinh reflect in part the calls for ''renovation'' of the Communist system made by the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  ''Socialism must strive to prove its all-round superiority over capitalism,'' said Mr. Chinh, 79 years old, a member of the Ho Chi Minh generation of hard-line Communists.  But his criticism drew attention to ''great difficulties'' that have held back Vietnam's development in the years it has been under the tutelage of Moscow.  Diplomats in the region appear divided on whether Hanoi believes it has received the wrong kind of aid or whether Moscow has concluded its assistance has been squandered. When Mr. Chinh went to the Soviet Union for a meeting in August, his reception was described as less than enthusiastic.  Hanoi, diplomats say, has been watching events in China very closely, while continuing to reject a radical move away from the Communist system. The leadership, which is still largely North Vietnamese, has also been influenced to some degree by the formerly free-enterprise South Vietnam, which remains the country's most dynamic region, according to Bangkok-based international economists. Several South Vietnamese officials are thought to be making their way into the country's ruling circles.  In addition, young Vietnamese tell visitors that they have been greatly impressed by the material progress they encounter when sent to study or work in the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe, and this raises questions about why development has not kept pace in Vietnam.  Speaking to a Hanoi party audience, Mr. Chinh appeared to confirm what visitors to Hanoi have noticed for the first time over the last year: a growing and outspoken public disenchantment with both the policies and the practices of government. Speaking to the army, the party leader also called for more ''material and morale support for the front line.''  More than 11 years after the end of the Vietnam War, the country, now at war in Cambodia, remains one of the world's poorest nations, falling farther and farther behind its non-Communist Southeast Asian neighbors.  Mr. Chinh singled out for special attack in talks to both military and political audiences the policy of concentrating on heavy industry at the expense of crafts and cottage industries or expanded commodities production.  Many of Vietnam's largest projects, in industry and energy, have been developed with Soviet aid and advice. Mr. Chinh's rejection of ''doing things on a larger scale than our capability permits'' is interpreted by some diplomats in the region as an expression of annoyance with the poor results of more than a decade of dependence in Moscow for development.

"   , Thailand, Oct. 29   Four United States military specialists went to Hanoi today for technical talks aimed at resolving the status of 1,786 Americans listed as missing in action in the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975.  The talks, the fourth round this year, had been set for Oct. 8, but were suddenly canceled by Vietnam with no explanation. The technical talks began in December 1982.  The American. delegation is headed by Lieut. Col. Joe Harvey, commander of the Honolulu-based United States Joint Casualty Resolution Center, the military unit in charge of settling the issue.  The other Americans are two officers of the center's Bangkok office and Thorne Helgeson, chief of the Army Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu, which analyzes remains to determine if they are those of missing Americans.  The Vietnamese side is headed by Nguyen Can, head of a Foreign Ministry office for resolving the question.  Washington and Hanoi do not have diplomatic relations.  One American goal in the talks is to win an agreement on a second United States-Vietnamese excavation of a warplane crash site to search for remains. Last year, the first joint dig produced wreckage of a B-52 bomber and bone fragments. It was regarded as a milestone in the search effort.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",October 30 1986 ,3
"    NIKHOM, Thailand   For six years as a political prisoner of the Communist Governent of Laos, the former Laotian official said, he was sustained by memories of Cornell University, where he studied in the 1970's.  ''To sit in the library, to collect books on Laos, to do some research myself -that was my dream,'' Viliam Phraxayavong said in an interview at a refugee transit center here. ''It's lovely there, Ithaca.''  His dream was dashed in 1985 when, he says, the United States turned down his request for refugee resettlement because of Communist associations.  His case, some officials say, is one of many in Southeast Asia that reflect an ambivalence or inconsistency on the part of the Reagan Administration in dealing with those seeking asylum from Communist countries. On Asylum in U.S.Some refugee officials say that although circus performers from the Soviet Union get asylum, technically or professionally skilled Laotians, Cambodians and Vietnamese often do not. And while deserting Afghan soldiers are assisted by Washington, Vietnamese Army deserters are told they have almost no chance for resettlement.  ''For the Afghans, the Administration pulls out the stops,'' one official said. Meanwhile, more than 500 Vietnamese soldiers are in a Thai camp.  American immigration law clearly bars people who have been associated with Communist organizations or governments. But exceptions can be made for refugees who can demonstrate a fear or experience of persecution.  Interviewer's Responsibility  The burden of making the difficult judgment whether an applicant meets that criterion falls on an interviewer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Once the decision is made, there is no formal appeal process, a spokesman said here.  An Immigration and Naturalization spokesman in the United States Embassy in Bangkok said that he could not discuss individual cases, but that he doubted that association with the Laotian Government alone could have led to a denial of asylum. He said that as a general rule, all aspects of an applicant's case are considered when a decision is made, and that a person who has been living more or less comfortably in a job and home, by contrast to one fleeing for his life, can often not prove persecution and is turned down.  Immigration officials do not put a reason for denial on the record, the spokesman said, because it might prejudice resettlement elsewhere.  Refugee officials say many Southeast Asians with links to Americans in the 1960's and early 1970's are now suspect or subject to persecution under Communist governments.  In another case in Thailand, a Cambodian defector from the Vietnamese-backed Government in Phnom Penh recently told a reporter from Agence France-Presse that he had been promised a visa to the United States by people he described as Central Intelligence Agency operatives for whom he performed some tasks he declined to describe since his flight in 1984.  Political Training Program  The defector, Sek Sen, 41 years old, said he had been involved in the political training of Communist Party officials in Phnom Penh before fleeing. Sek Sen, who is described as the highest-ranking Phnom Penh official to defect, told the reporter he was fearful of going back to Cambodia. United States officials do not comment on assertions of C.I.A. involvement along the Cambodian border or elsewhere.  ''I did all I could to help the Americans before 1975,'' Mr. Viliam said, recalling a period when he was a liaison officer on international projects. ''And do you know what words they paint on me now? 'Security issue!' ''  Mr. Viliam, a 52-year-old graduate of University of Bordeaux, was an official in the National Bank of Laos from 1962 to 1965, then Deputy Director General of the Ministry of Economic and Social Planning until 1975, when the Communist faction of the neutralist coalition pushed out its partners and assumed full control.  Period of 'Re-education'  Like many other non-Communist nationalists, he said, he was sent into ''re-education'' before the December 1975 Communist takeover.  In May 1975, students marched to his office, he said, carrying placards: ''Viliam, you are an agent of the C.I.A. Quit your ministry immediately!''  Soon after, he was sent to what was described as a prolonged ''conference'' or ''seminar.'' One day, without warning, armed policemen surrounded his study group and he was led away.  On his release in 1981, he said he decided to return to government service to educate himself on what the new Government was all about. He said he did not want to make a hasty decision to leave the country, as many other former prisoners did.  ''As a Lao, I think this is one country worth living in,'' he said. He was given a job negotiating irrigation projects for the Ministry of Agriculture.  'Not Safe for Me to Stay'  ''Finally I realized after three years, it was not safe for me to stay,'' he said. ''So many people were arrested.'' During a boat festival in September 1984, when there was a lot of activity in the Mekong River, Mr. Viliam, his wife and his two daughters and a son rowed across the river to Thailand.  Mr. Viliam said that because he had worked closely as a Government official with the United States Agency for International Development before 1975, he assumed he would be allowed to return to Cornell and take up an academic life. In July 1985, he was told by immigration authorities here in Thailand that he did not meet American criteria for refugee admission.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",November 1 1986 ,0

The Vietnamese also said they were investigating 19 new reports about the discovery of other remains, according to Col. Joe Harvey, who had three days of talks in Hanoi on accounting for some 1,790 Americans reported missing in action.  Colonel Harvey, commander of the Honolulu-based United States Joint Casualty Resolution Center, said no date was set for the turnover of the remains of what the Vietnamese believe are the bodies of three Americans, but that it is expected to take place soon.

"   , Thailand, Nov. 2   United States officials investigating American servicemen listed as missing in action in the Vietnam War have inspected a site in northern Vietnam where an American warplane might have crashed, officials said today.  Lieut. Col. Joe Harvey, head of the Hawaii-based Joint Casualty Resolution Center and leader of a delegation that met with Vietnamese officials last week, said the possible crash site is a few miles outside of Haiphong.  ''We did not see much, just a crater,'' Colonel Harvey said. ''The Vietnamese had correlated the site with one of the M.I.A. case files that we presented earlier and we will have to see if the correlation is correct.''  United States officials have proposed the excavation of several crash sites in the Hanoi-Haiphong corridor but have failed to reach an agreement on the issue in meetings this year with Vietnamese officials.

"   , Thailand, Nov. 14   Vietnam has devalued its currency for the third time in less than two years, indicating a continuing failure to curb rapid inflation or solve other economic problems.  According to an announcment last week in Hanoi by its Central Bank, the Vietnamese unit of currency, the dong, has been devalued from 15 to 80 to the United States dollar.  Before the devaluation, the dollar (pegged officially at 15 dong since September 1985) had been buying up to 430 dong on the black market, according to residents of Hanoi. The black market exchange rate is considered by diplomats to be a more realistic indicator of the state of the Vietnamese economythan the official exchange rates.

"   , Thailand, Nov. 26   Vietnam today handed over what it described as the remains of three Americans missing in action in the Vietnam War, an American officer said.  The turnover in Hanoi came as Vietnam neared the halfway point of its pledge to resolve the issue of missing servicemen by the end of 1987.  American officials, who list 1,784 servicemen missing in Vietnam, say Hanoi must significantly accelerate its efforts to accomplish that goal. The total number of missing, including those lost in Laos and Cambodia, is 2,424.  A 15-member United States military delegation received the remains in a short ceremony at Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi, said the leader of the group, Lieut. Col. Paul Mather. He said the three coffins, each covered with a folded American flag, were loaded onto a C-141 transport plane and flown to Honolulu for analysis at the Army laboratory there.  Hanoi usually provides tentative identification, but Colonel Mather said only that the Vietnamese had informed American officials that they found the remains while checking reports from villagers.  In April, Vietnam made one of its largest turnovers - the remains of what it said were 21 Americans.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",November 27 1986 ,3

"   , Thailand, Dec. 14   Vietnam's Communist leaders meet this week in a crucial party congress that they say will have to set a new course for the country if Hanoi is to overcome debilitating economic and political problems.  The party congress, the third since the unification of the country in 1975, is expected to start naming a new generation of national leaders, the first in half a century. Vietnam, one of the world's poorest countries - partly through its own mistakes, its leaders concede - may also commit itself to new economic policies.  ''The Vietnamese people are at a new stage of their revolution,'' an announcer for the Voice of Vietnam said Saturday, as she described preparations for the congress, which opens Monday.  ''A festival atmosphere is prevailing in Hanoi,'' she said. Six huge artificial lotus blooms have been constructed downtown, she added, and ''500 new products have been named to honor the Sixth Party Congress.'' #20 Foreign Delegations Tonight the voice of Vietnam reported the arrival of more than 20 foreign delegations, including one from the Communist Party of the United States and one representing the El Salvador leftist guerrilla front.  Behind the scenes, preparations have been less joyous, according to the Vietnamese news reports. The official radio announced that hundreds of thousands of petitions have come in from citizens around the country, citing problems in need of attention.  ''The party continues to secure many important achievements,'' a domestic broadcast said on Dec. 7. ''But it has been and is meeting with numerous great difficulties and committing many serious shortcomings that erode the people's confidence.  ''Although there have been many motivation drives to build up the party against negativism, they have failed to bring about the desired results,'' the program, reviewing articles in the magazine Tap Chi Cong San, said. The broadcast was monitored and translated by the British Broadcasting Corporation.  ''The scourge of corruption continues to develop widely in various forms,'' it said. ''Party discipline and state law has deteriorated to an unprecedented degree.''  'Odious' Trends Attacked  A week earlier, an editorial in the Vietnamese Army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan bitterly attacked what it called ''odious'' trends in society. It went on to spell out the problem.  ''These negative phenomena,'' it said, ''consist of acts of speculation for gainful purpose, corruption and graft, misappropriation of public property, officialism, arrogance, bribe-taking, and undisciplined lifestyle, liberalism, lack of responsibility, disrespect for the law, disruption of order, lack of civilization, disregard for fine customs, and more.''  The possible role of the army in forcing change has been a matter of speculation in Southeast Asia and among scholars in the United States. Regular readers of Vietnamese military publications say there may be growing military dissatisfaction with the country's underdevelopment and with the conduct of the nine-year-old war in Cambodia.  The name of Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the strategist in wars against both the French and Americans, has reappeared after a period of some obscurity. Some diplomats in Hanoi said they believed that General Giap, who apparently questioned the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, may now be among the candidates to succeed Pham Van Dong as Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister, who is 80 years old and very frail, has indicated he wants to retire.  Party Leader to Be Chosen  The most important development expected at the congress will be the announcement of a new party leader to follow Le Duan, a contemporary and successor of Ho Chi Minh. Mr. Duan, who died in July, was temporarily replaced by Truong Chinh, 79. Observers now think Mr. Chinh may intend to stay on.  In series of tough speeches this fall, Mr. Chinh, a former leftist radical whose forced collectivization program was thought to have resulted in many deaths in the 1950's, joined those calling for ''renovation'' of the economy.  Among other figures mentioned often enough in Vietnamese news reports to suggest they may be on the rise are Nguyen Van Linh, a southerner who was removed from the Politburo in 1982 and then reinstated last year without explanation, and Vo Van Kiet, the country's embattled economic planner, whose earlier changes met resistance.  Vo Chi Tong, now Deputy Prime Minister and the author of popular agricultural policies that rewarded farmers' initiative, is another possible candidate for Prime Minister or other top post.  Sharp Change Unlikely  But diplomats caution against expecting too sharp a change in policy from the party congress. The country's Communist Party, with 1.8 million members, remains at heart ideologically orthodox, an orthodoxy solidified and never seriously challenged through two wars.  In addition, most new leaders likely to emerge this week are men well into their 60's or 70's.  Only in peacetime, and only in the last year or two, has there been any noticeable display of public discontent in Vietnam, north as well as south. The depth and danger of this discontent is now being acknowledged in Hanoi.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 14 1986 ,1
"   , Thailand, Dec. 17   Vietnam announced the resignation of its three top leaders today.  The departure of the three - Prime Minister Pham Van Dong; Truong Chinh, the Communist Party's General Secretary, and Le Duc Tho, the Politburo member who led Hanoi's team in negotiating the United States withdrawal from Vietnam - marks the most dramatic political change in 56 years of party history and more than three decades of independence.  Replacements are expected to be named Thursday at the closing session of the Sixth Communist Party Congress, now in its third day in Hanoi.  In a speech on Monday to the opening session, Mr. Chinh suggested that a ''purification'' or purge of the party might follow this week's meeting.  The resignations in effect bring to an end a half-century of unbroken control of the Vietnamese Communist Party -and later Hanoi's Communist Government - by the remarkable band of revolutionaries who formed around Ho Chi Minh, the party's founder, in the 1920's and 1930's. Ho died in 1969.  It is too early to determine whether policy changes will follow. Vietnam acknowledges that it faces serious economic problems and a crisis of confidence in its political leadership. Hanoi is also involved in a difficult and unpopular war in Cambodia, according to defectors from the Vietnamese Army and disgruntled citizens in both the north and the south.  According to the official Voice of Vietnam, the three leaders are retiring because of ''old age and health conditions.'' They will, however, become ''advisers'' to the Central Committee, according to the broadcast, which added that they would be able ''to contribute further to the collective wisdom of the party.''  Vietnam has barred most Western reporters from the country during the party congress. According to the Vietnamese Embassy here, 14 reporting visas were granted, most of them to television crews from Japan, Australia and Britain. American newspapers are represented by The Associated Press.  Possible Contenders  The three names most often mentioned as contenders for Mr. Chinh's job as party leader are Nguyen Van Linh, 73 years old, a former party secretary in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon; Vo Chi Cong, 73, a Deputy Prime Minister, and Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the military stragetist behind the wars against France and the United States. General Giap, who diplomats say questioned Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1978, has been in eclipse for several years.  The three leaders' decision not to run for re-election to the party's Central Committee was announced today by Interior Minister Pham Hung, another member of the founding generation.  The broadcast said the congress had honored the three men ''for great services rendered to the party and people of Vietnam.'' Witnesses said the three then waved goodbye to their fellow party members.  Mr. Dong (pronounced DOME), who is 80 and very frail, had been expected to retire. But the departures of Mr. Chinh, 79, and Mr. Tho, 76, surprised many diplomats and scholars.  Mr. Chinh, who became leader of the party - and in effect of the country -after the death of Le Duan in July, had recently been described as looking fit. Since early fall, he appeared to be leading the ''self-criticism'' campaign that acknowledged the country's problems to audiences at home and abroad.  Mr. Tho, a cosmopolitan but often apparently humorless man, had often been suggested as a candidate for one of the country's highest posts.  Factions in Leadership  According to Thai Quang Trung, a Vietnamese-born, Paris-educated exile historian of the party, the removal of Mr. Chinh and Mr. Tho at the same time may be an attempt to deal evenhandedly with two persistent factions of the party leadership, roughly described a pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese.  In a monograph written for Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Mr. Trung described Mr. Chinh as spokesman for a northern sector of the party influenced by Mao Zedong. Mr. Tho, a southerner whom Mr. Trung believed to be the leader the pro-Moscow wing, had been a rival of Mr. Chinh for decades.  Truong Chinh - a pseudonym meaning ''long march'' that he adopted as a young man when most of his associates were under the influence of the Chinese Communist movement - had been an advocate of radical agricultural change in the 1950's. When his forced collectivization plans cost many Vietnamese lives and considerable eonomic damage, he was pushed to the background of the party hierarchy.  Urged 'Prolonged War'  He had also advocated a ''prolonged war'' in what was then South Vietnam, rather than the quicker and more decisive military action urged by Mr. Tho.  As the war against the pro-Western South ended with a sudden North Vietnamese military sweep in 1975 and Hanoi was drawn into the orbit of Moscow, Mr. Chinh's future seemed unpromising.  But Vietnam, unlike many other Communist nations, did not experience cataclysmic leadership splits. So Mr. Chinh was eventually rehabilitated. Mr. Duan, whom he succeeded as leader, was considered by many to be a pro-Moscow man.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 17 1986 ,1
"   , Thailand, Dec. 18   A 73-year-old political administrator who built his career as Hanoi's representative in the south before and after the takeover of Saigon was named head of the Communist Party of Vietnam today.  The election of Nguyen Van Linh to the top party post was announced in Hanoi during the closing session of the Sixth Communist Party Congress. It makes him the country's most powerful figure and the first ruler not to be a member of Ho Chi Minh's inner circle.  Mr. Linh replaces Truong Chinh, whose resignation as General Secretary of the party was announced Wednesday as part of the most sweeping reorganization of the party leadership in half a century. Five of 13 Politburo members have lost their seats in the last two days.  Mr. Linh, a figure little known outside Vietnamese Communist Party circles, is frequently associated with a group of economic pragmatists, many of them with experience in the south, who have advocated some liberalization of the economy.  Significance Not Yet Clear  But the congress did not produce bold new economic policies, and most experts say it is therefore too early to say whether Vietnam has been turned over to a generation of reformers.  In other changes announced today, Vietnam's Defense Minister, Senior Gen. Van Tien Dung, was dropped from the Politburo. He will lose his ministerial position.  No reason was given for General Dung's departure from a job he held since 1980, the year after Vietnam toppled the Government of its neighbor, Cambodia. Ever since, Cambodia has been the site of an inconclusive war with which General Dung and Le Duc Tho, who was dropped from the Politburo yesterday, have been associated.  The name of Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the hero of Dien Bien Phu and the war against South Vietnam, was missing from today's Politburo appointments. He was returned to the Central Committee rather than being named, as expected, to a higher party post after having spent several years on the fringes of power.  A Rise in Status  However, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach rose from the position of Politburo alternate to its eighth-ranking member.  Vietnamese officials would not comment on whether Mr. Thach, who is well known abroad, might leave the ministry for other government tasks. But one official pointed out that Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son had joined the party's Central Committee, a steppingstone to higher office.  Another official who has promoted economic changes, the state planning director, Vo Van Kiet, moved up from tenth place in the hierarchy to fifth.  One newcomer to the Politburo was Mai Chi Tho, the brother of Le Duc Tho. Mai Chi Tho had been mayor and party secretary in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, and is considered one of Vietnam's leading experts on state security.  Nguyen Thanh Binh, secretary of the Hanoi party committee, also joined the Politburo, as did Gen. Doan Khue, who had been First Deputy Minister of Defense.   Prime Ministership Still Vacant  Although no one was named today to fill the Prime Minister's position vacated Wednesday by Pham Van Dong, the veteran revolutionary, the rankings in the new Politburo list indicate that the job may go to Vo Chi Cong, now a Deputy Prime Minister.  Mr. Cong moved up from seventh place on the Politburo list to third. He is separated from the top position by Pham Hung, the last of Ho Chi Minh's inner circle, who is reported to have declined the prime ministership.  Government ministries, as distinct from party positions, are to be allocated when the National Assembly meets, probably in the last week of the year, officials say.  Mr. Cong, who was formerly Agriculture Minister, has been an advocate of more incentives for farmers as a means of raising food production. Increased food supply has been made one of the top policy priorities at the congress, along with the production of more consumer goods and the development of more export industries to earn hard currency.  A Need for Development  Vietnam is suffering severe economic problems and needs capital and technology for development. Western nations and Japan have withheld aid since Hanoi invaded Cambodia.  The appointment of Mr. Linh (pronounced LING) to the country's top post was widely expected, and seemed to be confirmed when he gave the opening speech of the congress on Monday.  Mr. Linh, who was born in Hanoi, made his reputation in the 1960's and 1970's as North Vietnam's top official with Vietcong forces in South Vietnam during the war against American forces and the Saigon Government.  After the war Mr. Linh returned to Hanoi, where he was appointed to the party's Central Committee and Politburo in 1976. Within a few years he was back in the south as party chief in Ho Chi Minh City.  A year later, Mr. Linh stepped down from the Politburo and the party's administrative body, the Secretariat. Some scholars believe he may have been moved aside because he had failed to reorganize the south fast enough.  While in the south, Mr. Linh became identified with economic measures that were designed to decentralize decision-making and to use material incentives to stimulate production.  As more members of the leadership were coming to hold similar views, Mr. Linh returned to the Politburo in 1985, perhaps vindicated.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 18 1986 ,1
"    So far only the faces are different in Vietnam, but policy changes could be next. If these bring relaxation of control at home and in Cambodia, they could be of enormous importance to the people of Indochina and open some interesting opportunities in the Soviet-Chinese-American triangle.  Economic reformers dominate the new leadership lineup announced at this week's Communist Party Congress. Vietnam has been mired in deep poverty, the price of doctrinaire Communism and aggression in Cambodia. The Vietnamese people need relief.  As for foreign relations, the new team might be ready to rethink policy toward Cambodia. Vietnam's military occupation of that country has been long and frightful, and fuels a deadly civil war. Hanoi's insistence on retaining control of Cambodia is the main reason the world has isolated Vietnam.  If the new leaders would shift the focus to development, they could reassess their present dependence on the Soviet Union. The Russians provide them, as an anti-Chinese ally, about $1 billion yearly. For Vietnam to leave Cambodia would allow repositioning between Moscow and Peking and help to open the door with Washington as well.  The party congress, the first since the death last summer of the veteran Communist leader Le Duan, designated Nguyen Van Linh as party chief, and replaced 5 of the 13 politburo members. Mr. Linh, the new party leader, was Hanoi's top official in South Vietnam before and after unification. His familiarity with the South's more open economic style made him an advocate of economic decentralization and raising production through material incentives rather than ideological exhortations. These views were resisted in the past and only the announcement of a new economic program will show how far Hanoi is prepared to go now. Nevertheless, the promotion of other leading economic reformers is a positive sign.  A hint of a possible change on Cambodia comes from the retirement of both Le Duc Tho and Gen. Van Tien Dung, two leaders closely linked to present policies. Economic revival virtually depends on reversing those policies, which have drained resources and provoked a cutoff of Western and Japanese assistance.  Vietnam's revolutionary cadres endured years of sacrifice, sustained by dreams of development and nationalist glory. Instead, they have reaped underdevelopment and dependence on support from Hanoi's only ally, the Soviet Union. If Vietnam's new leaders seek a constructive way out of the mess and provide more information about Americans missing in action and related issues, Washington should be ready to pay heed and encourage a welcome trend. Policy made in Vietnam can still reverberate in the largest capitals.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Editorial                      ",December 20 1986 ,1
"      TO the three Communist nations of Indochina, it has been a season for candid introspection and leadership change.  Such ''renewals'' are a trademark of ruling Communist parties from Moscow to Havana, a reflection of the difficulty of motivating societies with a centralized economy and an ideology that for the most part admits no heresy. For Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, the problem is greatly exacerbated by severe economic hardships.  At party congresses in Hanoi last week and in Laos last month, there was an extraordinary outpouring of self-criticism, expressed in usual catchwords such as ''shortcomings,'' ''serious mistakes,'' ''selfishness,'' ''laziness'' and ''corruption.'' Cambodia, too, has acknowledged its troubles, reshuffling its leadership in the last several weeks.  In Laos, which, like Cambodia, has been drawn into Hanoi's orbit through economic cooperation and the presence of Vietnamese troops and advisers, the Communist Party leader, Kaysone Phomvihan, listed 12 areas - from health to law enforcement - in need of immediate attention.  But the toughest appraisal came from Truong Chinh, the General Secretary of Vietnam's Communist Party, who last week apparently lost a fight to keep his title. At the party congress, he attacked ''corrupt phenomena in state machinery'' and lashed out at the failure to improve Vietnam's economy or inspire its people in the nearly 12 years since the end of the ''American war.''   Source of 'Shortcomings'  ''The mistakes and shortcomings committed in the economic field and socioeconomic leadership,'' he said, ''originate from shortcomings made in the party's ideological and organizational activities and cadre work.''  All three countries worry that they have inadequate national security. Cambodia and Vietnam, joined in a war against Chinese-backed guerrillas, dismissed their defense ministers. And Laos, while seeking improved ties with neighboring Thailand and, to a lesser degree, China, has called for expanded military conscription and more efficient armed forces.  Amid the criticisms and warnings, there are pleas for ''renovation'' - better management, more honest accounting, harder work. The leaders argue that nothing is wrong with the socialist system and blame inept bureaucrats for giving it a bad name.  The turmoil in Indochina is causing concern elsewhere - including Moscow, which remains committed to keeping its allies afloat. In Hanoi last week, Yegor K. Ligachev, a deputy to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, promised to double nonmilitary economic assistance to Vietnam, from about $1 billion to nearly $2 billion a year, over the next five years - despite Soviet complaints that its aid was being squandered.  ''Moscow attaches great importance to Vietnam,'' said Thai Quang Trung, a Vietnamese scholar who lives in Paris. ''Vietnam's integration with the Soviet bloc has reached the point of no return.'' Hanoi cannot be allowed to fail, he continued, or to continue to set a sad example for the region. Moreover, diplomats contend, Moscow is determined to keep Hanoi from drifting toward the heretical economic pragmatism of China. Vietnam is an invaluable military outpost for Soviet forces in the East and is critical to Moscow's new diplomatic push into Southeast Asia and the Pacific.  'Basket Cases'  Indochina's problems are made starker when contrasted to its non-Communist neighbors. The gap between Indochina and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei - continues to widen, even at a time of their economic slowdown. An economist for a regional United Nations organization in Thailand recently called Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia ''the world's new basket cases.''  What remedies have the Indochinese leaders proposed? Observers who have studied the Laotian and Vietnamese plans - Cambodia, caught in civil war, is a separate case -say the countries are committed to revitalizing their economies. But experts say this will be attempted in an atmosphere of moderation, curbing both the radicals who want a quicker march to socialism through collectivization and the pragmatists who favor free-market forces.  ''Stalinist'' economic planning, with its emphasis on heavy industry, will be abandoned, Vietnamese leaders say. Efforts will be made to increase exports outside the socialist bloc and to seek joint ventures. Officials know the restless young are not moved by appeals to sacrifice. ''People endure any hardship in time of war,'' a Vietnamese diplomat said last week. ''But in peacetime, their demands become very great.''

"   , Thailand, Dec. 22   Vietnam's poor economic performance was the overriding concern of Hanoi's governing Communists when they assembled last week for their Sixth Party Congress. But it is not the only problem to which the country's new leaders are giving immediate attention, records of the meetings indicate.  As diplomats and scholars begin to sift through voluminous speeches, articles and the comments of Vietnamese officials, they say it is apparent that the leadership faces factionalism within the party, a disgruntled army and, most important, a south that is still wayward and uncooperative. The south, in the view of some Hanoi officials, is the source of corruption, political deviation and ''many-faceted sabotage.''  ''South Vietnam is in a state of moral secession,'' the party historian Thai Quang Trung, who is based in Paris, said in a meeting with journalists in Bangkok on Friday.  Mr. Trung, an exile who is critical of Hanoi, said that within Vietnam the situation in the south was now being described by the Vietnamese aphorism, ''One thousand pounds hanging by a hair.''  A Sign of Deference  According to Douglas Pike, the head of the Indochina Studies Program at the University of California at Berkeley and the editor of the periodical Indochina Chronology, the naming of Nguyen Van Linh as party chief is ''a clear sign of deference to the south.''  Mr. Linh, who replaced Truong Chinh as General Secretary of the party on Thursday, served for more than 40 years in southern Vietnam. He was first an underground Communist organizer, then a liaison with the southern-based Vietcong, which officials now decribe as a wing of Hanoi's Communist Party, and finally, after the fall of the south, an administrator of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.  He was one of several important party officials with long experience in the south who were promoted during the congress last week or are expected, according to officials, to take high posts when the country's new Government lineup, as distinct from party lineup, is announced, probably before the end of the year.  The others include Pham Hung, the second-ranking official in the party hierachy, who may become head of the State Council, or President; Vo Chi Cong, who is in line to become Prime Minister; Vo Van Kiet, the head of national planning, and Mai Chi Tho, a security expert who was a popular and effective mayor of Ho Chi Minh City. These men have also been associated with experiments in economic liberalization.  Curbs on Repression Seen  ''This may bring an end, or a scaling down, of more repressive measures against the south,'' Mr. Pike said in a telephone interview.  ''In 1975, Hanoi's initial instinct had been to go slow on the south,'' he said. ''But before the end of that year they decided to opt instead for total and immediate integration. 'Breaking the machine,' they called it. What you may be seeing now is a redressing of this.  ''They may have made the decision that they really need the south,'' Mr. Pike said. Mr. Trung believes that the Politburo is heavily weighted with people who are thought to know ''how to deal with southerners - capitalists, Buddhists, Catholics, all sorts of people.''  Vietnamese news organizations have begun to reflect a new attitude. A week ago, when Vo Tran Chi, the party secretary for Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, spoke to the Congress, the official Hanoi radio described the former southern capital as ''a dynamic example of economic development for provinces throughout the country,'' according to a translation by the monitoring service of the British Broadcasting Corporation.  Specific Economic Requests  Mr. Chi then proceeded to give a speech almost free of jargon and very specific in its economic requests -more electricity to power a recovery, for example, and more qualified personnel to speed development.  If the south can finally be pacified, while contributing its agricultural, manufacturing and management skills to national development, experts say, the new leadership of Hanoi will have a major achievement to its credit.  Problems with the army have some roots in the economy, according to military publications. Both Mr. Trung and Mr. Pike, the author of a new history, ''P.A.V.N.: People's Army of Vietnam,'' believe that the army is probably the country's strongest and least divided institution at this point, and that its concerns must be addressed.  Early this month, a few days before the opening of the party congress, Quan Doi Nhan Dan, the army daily newspaper, complained of a lack of attention to the needs of troops. It portrayed a fighting force facing China that lacked warm clothes and lived on boiled potatoes while sleeping in crowded tents.  Morale Has Declined  In Cambodia, where officials have acknowledged problems of indiscipline and desertion compounded by malaria and many casualties from land mines, morale has declined, military pubications say.  Diplomats and other observers of the Vietnamese military are not convinced, however, that the departure from the Politburo last week of the country's Defense Minister, Senior Gen. Van Tien Dung, reflects problems between the party and army. His removal is thought by some to have a strictly political cause.  General Dung was thought to be close to Le Duc Tho, who also lost his Politburo seat last week, and to Le Duan, the party General Secretary who died in July. Mr. Chinh, who replaced Mr. Duan, had been a bitter rival of his predecessor for many years. Mr. Linh, who now takes over, was a protege of Mr. Chinh, and therefore it is thought that he may have helped engineer the dismissal of General Dung as Defense Minister.  Scholars say the existence of continued party factionalism is hard to prove. But Mr. Trung said some evidence, which he did not provide in detail, is emerging from Hanoi that indicates that Mr. Chinh made a last-minute attempt to keep the top party post but lost both that bid and a subsequent one to stay in the Politburo.  According to Mr. Trung's analysis, a deadlock over Mr. Chinh's future was broken by the simultaneous resignation of Mr. Chinh and Le Duc Tho, who was considered an ally of Le Duan.  Pham Van Dong, the country's Prime Minister, who also resigned, was in ill health and had been expected to retire.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 23 1986 ,1

"   , Thailand, Dec. 24   An important session of Vietnam's National Assembly opened today in Hanoi, according to the official radio, the Voice of Vietnam.  The assembly is expected to name the country's President and Prime Minister. But the Vietnamese Embassy here said there was no published timetable for this assembly session, which follows the Sixth Communist Party Congress last week. The official radio, heard in Bangkok tonight, also did not mention a schedule.  Over the last few days there have been reports from Hanoi suggesting that there are still disagreements within the party over appointments and policies. The pace and scope of economic change have been a major issue in Vietnam since the last party congress in 1982.  According to Agence France-Presse, the only Western news organization with a bureau in Hanoi, there has been a report in the Vietnamese Party theoretical journal suggesting that ''revolutionary violence'' will have to been applied to certain problem factions.  The Sixth Party Congress named a new party leader, Nguyen Van Linh. It also elected a new Politburo, the composition of which normally provides strong clues to who will take over top governmental positions, which are dominated by the party hierarchy.  It had been predicted by diplomats and officials in Hanoi last week that the presidency of the Council of Ministers, still held by Truong Chinh, who relinquished the party leadership position last week, would go to Pham Hung.

"   , Vietnam, April 10   Vietnam today turned over to the United States the bodies of 21 people believed to be missing American servicemen. It was the first repatriation of war dead this year and the third largest since 1975.  At Hanoi's international airport, an honor guard drawn from the four American military services escorted each coffin into a C-141 transport plane.  Hanoi used the occasion to warn the United States that the future of joint Vietnamese-United States efforts to resolve the issue of missing Americans could be in jeopardy.  Nguyen Can, the acting head of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's North American Department, said the two-year deadline set last year by Hanoi for resolving the missing and prisoner of war issue cannot be met if there are what he called ''statements that vilify or discredit Vietnam in Washington.''

"   , Vietnam, April 12   Hanoi, saying it is disappointed that progress in the search for Americans missing since the Vietnam War has not elicited ''cooperation and good will'' from the United States, has suddenly shifted to a much harsher public stance toward Washington.  The shift, which comes after less than a year of improving relations, raises the possibility that efforts to determine the fate of more than 1,700 Americans still unaccounted for in Vietnam will be halted, according to Hanoi officials.  Recent public statements from Hanoi also indicate that the Vietnamese are becoming alarmed at signs of reinvigorated Thai-American military cooperation and the likelihood that more American support will be given to rebels fighting the Vietnamese-backed Government of Cambodia.  'A U.S. Comeback'  After Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger toured the Cambodian border area last Tuesday while on a visit to Thailand, the Vietnamese News Agency, envisioning what it called ''a U.S. comeback to Southeast Asia,'' said:  ''The military cooperation between Washington and Bangkok is increasing to the dangerous point of reopening U.S. military bases in Thailand. This dangerous policy of Bangkok is directly threatening the fundamental national interests of Thailand.''  On Thursday, Vietnam turned over to the United States the remains of 21 people believed to be missing American servicemen. It was the first repatriation of war dead this year and the third largest since 1975.  But in a meeting with reporters today, Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son said that ''in the absence of cooperation and goodwill from the United States, a lot of obstacles could be created'' in the search for missing Americans.  The Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan has recently begun to attack American officials for what it said were statements indicating the United States was ''ready to use force, if necessary, to free any American prisoners'' in Vietnam. The attacks were apparently a reaction to testimony in Congress by Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, who said the United States would take ''appropriate action'' if it was determined that the Vietnamese Government was holding Americans in Vietnam.  Another article in Nhan Dan criticized the State Department for saying there were violations of human rights in Vietnam. The newspaper called the annual human rights report a ''brazen slander and a manifestation of the U.S. hostile attitude toward the Vietnamese people.''  ''The Washington authorities,'' the article said, ''have spent large amounts of money for propaganda campaigns against Vietnam, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in hopes of covering up the fact that they themselves are the most brazen violators of human rights in the world.''  Mr. Son, charging that the United States has rejected two sets of Vietnamese proposals for a joint agreement on solving the missing-in-action issue, today called for a written accord between the two nations. He declined to elaborate on what was in the proposals, but the Vietnamese have long sought a two-year timetable for completion of outstanding missing-persons cases.  The United States has rejected a written accord in the belief that this would hinder Washington from pursuing the issue after the time limit expired.  Mr. Son repeated a charge made earlier this week by Nguyen Can, head of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's department of North American affairs, that suggestions by some Americans that the Hanoi Government was holding live Americans had slowed the search process. Hanoi denies that there are any living Americans in the country; Mr. Son said Saturday that he had been misquoted by members of an American delegation that visited Hanoi in February. The group, led by Mr. Armitage, had reported that Mr. Son said some Americans may be living in remote areas without Hanoi's knowledge.  A loss of momentum on this issue -coming less than a year after what Washington considered to be a breakthrough with Hanoi - would follow a pattern of ill-fated efforts to resolve problems between the two nations.  Among the now-stalemated questions are the Amerasian children and ''re-education'' camp inmates who the Reagan Administration has said it would be willing to resettle in the United States. Also stalled is the Orderly Departure Program, under which Vietnamese leave their country legally for the United States and other Western nations under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Causes and Consequences  Hanoi has always taken the position that its offer last summer to resolve the missing Americans issue ''within two years'' was strictly a humanitarian gesture.  But at the same time, diplomats say, the Vietnamese may have thought that a gesture of good will on their part would quickly be reciprocated by the Americans. Diplomats are almost unanimous in saying that Hanoi still puts a very high priority on getting United States diplomatic recognition.  Diplomats also suggest that the steady succession of delegations from the United States coming to Vietnam to discuss the issue of missing Americans might have left Hanoi officials with the impression that this issue was more important to the United States than the continuing Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.  The diplomats say it is the Vietnamese presence in Cambodia that has soured relations between Hanoi and most nations outside the Soviet bloc. The United States has taken the same position: that Cambodia is the ultimate issue.  A foreigner in Phnom Penh, however, said the Vietnamese are shrewd and experienced readers of American political signals, and may think it possible to extract concessions from Washington ''by playing the M.I.A. card.''

"    Three American theater artists, one of them a Vietnam War veteran, will visit Vietnam later this month in what they hope will be the beginning of a cultural exchange, the first between the United States and Vietnam since the fall of Saigon 11 years ago.  If the Vietnamese and American Governments permit the visit to be reciprocated, it is likely that some Vietnamese artists will perform this fall at Joseph Papp's Public Theater.  After four years of attempts and missed chances, the director Thomas Bird, the mime Bill Irwin and the writer-performer Spalding Gray received visas this week from Vietnam. They will enter Vietnam via Bangkok on April 27 or 28 and will depart after visits to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) on May 8.  Mr. Bird, the artistic director of the Vietnam Veterans Ensemble Theater Company, served as an Army infantryman in Vietnam from August 1965 to August 1966. He has visited Vietnam twice since the end of the war -in 1981 as part of a delegation of veterans discussing such issues as Agent Orange and American soldiers who remained unaccounted for, and in 1982 on a more general visit with a delegation including Mr. Papp.  Trip 'Solely Cultural'  ''Exchanging culture and arts like this is a way of warming relations between our countries,'' Mr. Bird said yesterday. ''We will not be discussing anything political on this trip. It's solely a cultural trip.''  Tran Khanh, a press officer with the Vietnamese mission to the United Nations, said yesterday: ''The cultural exchange between Vietnam and the United States will be very beneficial to both sides. We hope that exchanges of this kind will increase our nations' understanding of each other.''  Mr. Bird said that the American delegation plans to meet with Nguyen Van Hieu, the Vietnamese minister of culture, and ''to see as much music and theater as we can,'' with an eye toward spotting individuals or arts groups that might be invited to perform in New York in the fall.  Mr. Irwin, a mime who won a MacArthur Foundation grant two years ago, will perform in Vietnam, Mr. Bird said. Mr. Bird is bringing copies of the play ''Tracers,'' which the Vietnam Veterans Ensemble Theater Company developed and performed last year. And he said it is possible that Mr. Gray will perform portions of his monologue ''Swimming to Cambodia,'' which is now being translated into Vietnamese.  Circus Popular in Hanoi  Mr. Bird said he chose Mr. Gray to accompany him because when they played together in the film ''The Killing Fields,'' he discovered Mr. Gray's deep interest in Vietnam. Part of the monologue ''Swimming to Cambodia,'' in fact, concerns the two men's attempt in 1983 to attain a visa from the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok.  As for Mr. Irwin, Mr. Bird said, ''I thought of Bill because his work was nonverbal. He should go over well there, because I'm told one of the most popular things in Hanoi is the circus.''

"      Vietnam notified the United States today that it was suspending talks on resolving the question of Americans still listed as unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, the State Department said.  In the official message to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, Hanoi said ''the current situation is not favorable'' for holding the next meeting on the missing-in-action Americans that had been set for next Wednesday and Thursday in Hanoi, Bernard Kalb, the department's spokesman, said.  But Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, at a meeting in New Delhi of the countries that describe themselves as nonaligned, said the discussions were being suspended because of the American air attacks on Libya.  The Hanoi move drew a quick warning from Washington. Mr. Kalb said this action would ''imperil any chance for improvement in the atmosphere between our two nations.''  Hanoi Pledge Cited  Noting that Hanoi had pledged last year to settle once and for all all questions dealing with the nearly 2,000 Americans still listed as unaccounted for in Vietnam, Mr. Kalb said:  ''If Vietnam now decides to abandon that pledge and to link this humanitarian enterprise to political issues, this can only increase the suffering of the families of those still missing, bring discredit to the Hanoi authorities and imperil any chance for an improvement in the atmosphere between our two nations.''  The Vietnamese have also apparently reneged on another pledge made to the United States - to turn over to the United States some 7,000 political prisoners who have been in so-called ''re-education camps.'' Many of these prisoners are Vietnamese with close ties to the United States, such as military and civilian officials in the former Saigon Government.  In 1984, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of Vietnam said Hanoi would release these prisoners if Washington would take them. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said then that the United States would take them and their relatives over a two-year period.  Report From Ex-Governor  A report made public today by a special panel on Indochinese refugees, headed by the former Governor of Iowa, Robert D. Ray, said that when the group visited Hanoi recently, ''Foreign Minister Thach was categorical in his refusal to discuss the issue, stating that it was now 'out of the question,' to release the prisoners.''  ''We found that there is great difficulty in getting cooperation or even getting them to acknowledge what they have previously said relative to the re-education camp prisoners,'' Mr. Ray said in a news conference today.  ''They refuse to call them prisoners,'' he said.  Although American officials dealing with the issue do not believe there are any Americans still alive, they would like to get more information from the Vietnamese on what happened to Americans who were known to have been captured during the war but who were never accounted for and to recover the remains of Americans from areas where there were known to be plane crashes.  The United States at the end of 1985 listed 1,797 Americans as unaccounted for in Vietnam, 700 in the north, and 1,097 in the south. In addition, 556 are listed as unaccounted for in Laos, 82 in Cambodia, and 6 in China, for a total of 2,441.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 19 1986 ,2
"    To the Editor:  Your article reporting a new chill from Hanoi in relations with the U.S. (front page, April 13) could just as well have spoken of a continued U.S. chill in relations with Vietnam. Having recently returned from a visit to Vietnam with a private U.S. humanitarian-aid delegation, and met with the two key Vietnamese officials you quote, as well as others, I find there is more to the story than reported.  Vietnamese officials believe the United States is continuing hostile policies against their country, that what we failed to win by war, we are trying to make up in other ways. They cite our refusal to grant diplomatic relations, our opposition to their policies in Cambodia (which, rightly or wrongly, they believe to be inhibiting Chinese efforts, through Pol Pot, at hegemony in Southeast Asia) and our creating a 60,000-strong backlog of dissatisfied Vietnamese promised entry to the U.S. but unable to be approved by both sides. Unspoken but doubtless believed, as well, is a U.S. hand in fomenting reported active resistance to the government in South Vietnam. And now the further tension over reported sightings, which are not taken seriously by any outside observers, of live Americans held against their will in North Vietnam. The Vietnamese are a proud and defiant people, and there are at least two sides to every story. Yet no visitor, however skeptical, can fail to be impressed by the vast gulf in national perspectives. To them, Ho Chi Minh was George Washington far more than a Communist, and no amount of insistence to the contrary could budge them from believing in the rectitude of their successful liberation struggle.  Why, we were asked, does the U.S. continue to oppose relations with Vietnam? Why, contrary to our postwar policies toward Germany and Japan, does the U.S. oppose assistance for Vietnam's development? Explanations relating to the continuing trauma of our wartime memories and current disagreement over Cambodia do not strike them as sufficiently persuasive. They say they would like to be more helpful on servicemen missing in action, but do not feel their helpfulness is being reciprocated.  Listening to the Vietnamese and then to our own policy makers in Washington, one has the impression of a dialogue of the deaf. Until this changes on both sides, both we and they will perpetuate the needless burden of our traumatic common past, rather than forge a new cooperative future.JOHN G.

"    Each time I have been entertained in a Vietnamese home it has been a typical summer night in Washington - hot and humid. The hostess's choice of food has always seemed especially felicitous. The marvelous variety of unusual dishes and the lightness of the cuisine, with its finely tuned use of gentle seasonings, have been particularly appropriate for hot weather. So it is no wonder that such fare is especially appropriate for, and becoming increasingly popular at, stylish pool parties across the country.  As I was to find out later, the food is not at all difficult to prepare. That is, once you have mastered the use of a few ingredients that are unfamiliar to most Westerners, such as rice paper and lemon grass. Rice paper is the edible translucent paper used for making Vietnamese spring rolls, a specialty far more delicate than Chinese egg rolls, to which they are often compared. Lemon grass, sometimes called citronella root, imparts a distinctive lemony taste and fragrance to the food.  Salads, vegetables, fish, sprightly sauces -all conspire to tempt the palate of the diner who, given a choice on a summer's eve, might ordinarily opt for cold roast chicken and jellied consomme. But not if shrimp salad with mint or brochettes of beef scented and spiced with galangal, an unusually piquant form of ginger, are offered as alternatives.  With the first exposure to the subtle refinements of the Vietnamese kitchen, the uninitiated American quickly puts aside any preconceptions of the food as being the same as Chinese. These cuisines do have many ingredients in common and both are properly eaten with chopsticks, but the similarity ends there. Despite 1,000 years of Chinese rule, ending in the 10th century, the Vietnamese maintained their identity not only in their own language and customs but in their own culinary sophistication.  Other cultures have had more of an influence. There is an easily definable French presence in the Vietnamese kitchen, and traces of Indian cooking also can be found. The resulting cuisine is a rather sophisticated one that reflects the richly varied history and geography of the country.  The food is almost always light. Uncooked vegetables and salads are an integral part of Vietnamese meals, which makes them especially appropriate for warm-weather entertaining. Shallots, Maggi seasoning, white potatoes and asparagus commonly are used. There is much less emphasis on stir-frying and thick sauces than is found in the Chinese kitchen, and lemon grass, unknown in China, is a hallmark of Vietnamese cooking. lthough Vietnam is quite small, about the size of New Mexico, its cooking is divided into regions. In the south, with its hot, humid climate, the French influence is the most pronounced. Indian curries are particularly strong there. Because sugar cane is grown in the region, dishes in the south tend to be sweeter than those elsewhere.  In the central region, where Hue, the ancient capital, is located, the food is rather decorative and very spicy. Hot chilies and shrimp sauce frequently are used.  To the north, with its colder weather, there are fewer ingredients and the food tends to be lighter and less heavily spiced. Black pepper is widely used, and stir-fried dishes are common.  It is not only the ingredients but the names given to some Vietnamese dishes that reflect the French influence, although the name is often as far as the Western influence goes. From the French the Vietnamese learned to make exquisite pates, but they often are seasoned with their famous sauce, nuoc mam, an anchovy-based mixture that is as popular as soy sauce is in China. The Vietnamese also have a chicken pate that is deep-fried.  Asparagus, which the Vietnamese call ''Western bamboo,'' is an essential ingredient in crab soup, a dish enjoyed all over the country and equally popular among Americans. Typical of the food of the country, it is both light and extremely savory. he recipes for this summer repast are creations of Bach-Yen Boun, chef at Indochine in New York City. Part Cambodian and part Vietnamese, she learned to cook at home in Cambodia. Her sister runs a Vietnamese restaurant they own in Paris called Au Coin des Gourmets. Despite its simplicity, Boun's food is not picnic fare. It is, however, especially appropriate for summer because it satisfies without leaving you stuffed.  These dishes - such as the Vietnamese spring rolls (called pates imperiaux in France); shrimp with mint rolled in rice paper (or rouleau de printemps); beef brochettes marinated in lemon grass paste, skewered with red peppers and onions; even the small, greaseless spareribs - will provide a dinner your guests are likely to remember for a long time. The cook will be happy because most of the dishes can be prepared and cooked in advance. And even those that require last-minute cooking can be prepared ahead almost completely.  Serve this food lukewarm or at room temperature, not steaming hot.

"    ARE there still American prisoners of war in Vietnam? It is a ''haunting question,'' as ''20/20'' says, a question that declines to be dismissed. It lingers because families want to believe that husbands, fathers and sons are still alive; it lingers because of unresolved issues. ''20/20'' explores the question of prisoners on ABC at 10 o'clock tonight.  Say immediately that ''20/20'' doesn't really answer the question. How could it? Short of a house-by-house, camp-by-camp search in Vietnam - an entirely unlikely possibility - it is impossible to prove no prisoners remain. In the absence of an actual repatriation, meanwhile, it is almost equally impossible to prove that prisoners do remain. The families of those missing in action, the M.I.A.'s, are trapped in a cruel dilemma.  The entire program, produced by Janice Tomlin, is devoted to the issue. The first part of the program challenges the Army's method of identifying the bodies that have been returned to this country. In fact, the word ''bodies'' scarcely applies. Some of the families, on opening the flag-draped coffins, have found only a few shards of bones.  Tom Jarriel, the ''20/20'' reporter, interviews independent anthropologists who challenge the Army's identifications. They call them ''outrageous,'' and insist that the fragmentary evidence makes positive identification impossible. Mr. Jarriel also interviews an Army colonel who is placed in the extraordinarily difficult position of defending the identifications. One may sympathize with the colonel; he is facing an uphill task.  Subsequently, Mr. Jarriel reports on profiteering at the expense of the M.I.A. families. Organizations and individuals sell them hope. ''20/20'' visits the Thai-Laotian border. Information about the missing men is for sale, most of it, apparently, spurious. Moreover, as Mr. Jarriel says, ''Bone merchants offer to sell American remains to the highest bidder.'' It is a cruel, commercial enterprise.  Nonetheless, the search continues, and so do the reports of the alleged sightings of American prisoners. There have been more than 800 reports since 1975. ''20/20'' gives us one of the most intriguing reports.  Mr. Jarriel talks to Representative Bill Hendon, Republican of North Carolina, who gets weekly briefings from the Defense Intelligence Agency on the alleged sightings. Mr. Hendon took it on himself to speak to Robert Garwood, who emerged from Vietnam in 1979, saying he had been held as a prisoner of war. He was court-martialed in 1981 and found guilty of collaborating with the enemy.  Mr. Garwood told Mr. Hendon that American prisoners remained in Vietnam, and drew a map of a military compound in Hanoi where he allegedly saw them. The map was supposedly identical to one drawn by a Vietnamese refugee, who also said that Americans were held in the compound.  The Defense Intelligence Agency, according to Mr. Hendon, dismissed the reports and the alleged sightings. One reason it did, apparently, was that one of the reports said the American prisoners were seen bathing. The intelligence agency said this could not be true; the compound had no cistern.  ''If the cistern's there, that's the key to it,'' Mr. Hendon says, ''and the only way you're ever going to know if the cistern's there, is if you walk in there and see it.''  Accordingly, Mr. Hendon visited Hanoi last February. We see him leaving a meeting with some colleagues, walking to the compound and finding the cistern. What does this prove? It is still unclear, but the Defense Intelligence Agency, ''20/ 20'' says, is now re-evaluating Mr. Garwood's information. ''20/20'' is doing an intriguing, and appalling, program.

"    WHEN I first tasted Vietnamese cooking in Paris nearly 20 years ago, I realized it was a cuisine to be reckoned with. When I visited Saigon several years later, I was convinced of this.  Today, America is home to almost 500,000 Vietnamese immigrants, according to State Department figures, and there are Vietnamese restaurants throughout the country. Yet, in New York - a city that seems to revel in ethnic diversity and savor the culinary riches that provides - first-rate Vietnamese restaurants offering authentic Vietnamese food are comparatively hard to find. In the Vietnamese restaurants that do exist, the kitchen repertory is often limited, Americanized or both.  Recently I set out to discover why and, in the process, to seek out noteworthy Vietnamese food.  The first Vietnamese dish I ever sampled was an appetizer called cha gio. An egg roll of sorts, it is a celebration food, served to herald events such as weddings, birthdays and the beginning of a new year. Over the years, it has become the principal food I use to judge a Vietnamese meal. Its preparation and presentation signals, fairly accurately, the care taken with the food that follows.  Although the ingredients vary from region to region, cha gio ideally consists of a filling of ground pork, soaked cellophane noodles, black fungus, garlic, chopped chives and crab meat. The mixture is spooned onto a softened rice paper wrapper, which is rolled into small packets and deep-fried in fresh oil until crisp and golden brown. Cha gio is served hot or lukewarm with a sauce made of nuoc mam, a fish sauce; garlic, hot chili peppers, lime juice, sugar and water.  The amount and quality of the crab meat is one standard by which I judge a cha gio: I like lots of crab meat. The quality of the sauce is another; it should be assertive but with no one ingredient overpowering the others. Then there is the presentation: Start with a large lettuce leaf and place on it a cha gio, a thinly sliced cucumber, mint leaf, coriander leaf, basil leaf and thin slices or rounds of carrot. The whole is bundled up, dipped into the sauce and eaten.  During the last few months, I have been eating at Vietnamese restaurants across the country. In most of them, cha gio was bland - as was the rest of the meal. Customers were handed token lettuce, often cut into too-small pieces, a cucumber slice and, maybe, mint.  There is, of course, more to Vietnamese food than this one appetizer. Among the memorable dishes I sampled in Saigon all those years ago was pho, a soup made with chicken or beef and rice noodles plus a garnish of onion, lime, fish sauce, hot chilies, mint and fresh coriander leaves, and deep-fried perch-size fish fillets, garnished with dill, rice-noodle pancakes and thinned shrimp paste with lime juice.  And one cannot forget that the heart of Vietnamese cooking is the artful use of fresh herbs, principally garlic, shallots, chili peppers, lemon grass, fresh coriander, mint and scallions (or green onions).  But using even these as a guide, the majority of Vietnamese restaurants I tried failed in quality and authenticity. Most of the food at Le Duc in Los Angeles (Telephone 213-653-7652), for example, lacked zest, while the food at the Golden Turtle in San Francisco (415-221-5285)was too Americanized - very bland or excessively sweet. (The beef in rice paper with cold noodles, fresh coriander, mint and hot chilies, however, was outstanding.) There were exceptions, such as Chez Bach in Branford, Conn. (203-488-8779), where the cha gio is crisp, fairly bursting with crab meat and beautifully served. There is also a delectable platter of boneless chicken tidbits marinated in lime, threaded on skewers and broiled, and rice-paper pancakes filled with ground pork, chopped dark mushrooms, shallots and ginger and garnished with pieces of pork pate, bean sprouts and shredded lettuce.  The chef-owner is Bach Ngo. If, as some have said, great Vietnamese cooks are familiar with dishes cooked from the homes of royalty, then Mrs. Bach is a prime candidate: Her aunt married one of Vietnam's last kings. (Another Restaurant Chez Bach, under the same management, is in Westport, Conn., (203-227-6586) but I found the food lacked the flavor and flair of the Branford establishment.) In New York, Indochine, although offering both Vietnamese and Cambodian food, serves up fine Vietnamese fare. It is at 430 Lafayette Street near Astor Place (212-505-5111). The kitchen is presided over by Bach Yen Ta Boun, who was born in Phnom Penh. Her mother married a Vietnamese and during the war the family fled to Saigon.  Mrs. Bach is an artist in the kitchen. The cha gio is crisp and impeccably served. Pho was made with high-quality sliced beef and a rich beef broth, plus rice noodles, bean sprouts and fresh herbs.  Among the many fine Vietnamese restaurants in San Francisco, Mai's on Clement Street (415-221-3046) offered excellent cha gio (I had to ask for the lettuce and rice noodles, however). I also found a lovely clear broth with bean sprouts, pineapple cubes and shrimp. In the Old Town section of Alexandria, Va., East Wind (703-836-1515) serves a memorable spiced shrimp soup with fresh coriander, beef soup with noodles and grilled quail. Chicago's Mekong restaurant (312-271-0206) looked garish - right down to the artificial flowers - but offered good spicy chicken and beef with lemon grass as appetizers. In New York, at Cuisine de Saigon, 154 West 13th Street (212-255-6003), there is little variation in flavors among the foods - except for the ground shrimp on sugar cane. This specialty was prepared to perfection, broiled and served with rice paper and fresh coriander.  If my complaints about Vietnamese restaurant food in New York go little further than this, it is because there are so few Vietnamese restaurants there. Discussions with Vietnamese cooks throughout the country yielded several possible reasons for this. There is geography. Comparatively few Vietnamese have settled in New York, so there is as yet no thriving community that a restaurant would try to cater to with authentic cuisine. Geography, too, has made it difficult to obtain many of the fresh herbs and other ingredients on which Vietnamese cuisine depends.  At the same time, the Vietnamese who have opened restaurants, most of them simple family-run affairs, seem to lack the business acumen to deal with the morass of laws, regulations and tax structures characteristic of New York.  Mrs. Bach also told me that few of the Vietnamese chefs in Manhattan are well acquainted with the formal cuisine that came from the kitchens of affluent residents in Hanoi, Hue and Saigon; I agree. She suggested that many of them serve unauthentic foods because they know no better and believe Americans will not know the difference.

"      Le Duan, the head of the Vietnamese Communist Party and one of the architects of victory in the Vietnam War, died today in Hanoi. He was 78 years old.  He had proved to be a faithful and able executor of the ''political will'' of Ho Chi Minh by managing to maintain the collective leadership that Ho left as a legacy on his death in 1969.  The death of Mr. Duan, who had clearly seemed to be first among equals in that durable leadership group, leaves a gap that will probably be filled at the sixth congress of the Communist Party, tenatively scheduled for late this year.  Le Duan (pronounced lay zwan) was one of the most important North Vietnamese leaders who oversaw the war against South Vietnam from the late 1950's until reunification of Vietnam was achieved in 1975 with the collapse of the South Vietnamese Army and Government.  Military as Well as Civilian  Like all members of the Vietnamese Politburo, he was a military as well as a civilian official, but his specialty was in the ''strategy of political struggle,'' the organization of the population for revolutionary warfare.  His death was announced by the Voice of Vietnam radio, which said he died after ''a period of serious illness.'' No cause of death was given, but some experts on Vietnamese affairs said there had been many reports that he suffered from a kidney ailment. He had traveled to the Soviet Union in December 1985 for medical treatment and made a brief appearance in January at the Soviet Communist Party Congress.  The broadcast said a state funeral would be held Tuesday in Hanoi.  Mr. Duan and his leadership colleagues showed a greater aptitude for war than for the problems of peace. Severe economic problems overtook Vietnam in the years after 1975, including a serious decline in rice production and distribution, according to analysts of the area.  Economic Incentives Tried  As secretary general of the party, Mr. Duan seemed to have been a leader of a recent move to use economic incentives to encourage greater productivity, a step that had some success but has fallen far short of the kind of market tools used in China and some other Communist nations.  Mr. Duan also took part in the decision to invade neighboring Cambodia and to replace the Khmer Rouge Government of Pol Pot with a more compliant regime.  ''He shared with the other members of the Politburo a rather martial outlook, a tendency to attack problems with the application of violent force,'' said Douglas Pike, the author of many works on Vietnamese Communism and director of the Indochina Studies Program at the University of California.  During his period of leadership, there were also large-scale border clashes with China, an expulsion of many ethnic Chinese citizens from Vietnam and a great exodus of ''boat people'' as refugees from the south.  In the labyrinth of Communist Party politics and bureaucracy, Mr. Duan had a reputation for subtle maneuver in ''bung di,'' a Vietnamese slang phrase loosely translated as faction fighting. But like his mentor Ho, in public he tried to ''stay above the dust of faction fighting,'' intervening only at critical junctures, Mr. Pike said.  Shared Power With 4  Although the size of the Politburo varied from 14 to 17 members in recent years, Mr. Duan essentially shared power with four other major figures: Prime Minister Pham Van Dong; Le Duc Tho, who negotiated the abortive peace treaty with the United States in 1973; Truong Chinh, a ideological theorist often at odds with the more pragmatic Mr. Duan, and Pham Hung, now a state security chief but during the war the on-scene leader of Communist forces in the South.  Prime Minister Dong is also reported to be very ill, and his retirement at the sixth party congress has been widely rumored. All of the top leaders are veterans of the first Indochina war against the French, and all are in their 70's.  The party congress had originally been scheduled for this spring, then for November and most recently for December. What changes it will bring are difficult to predict, several experts said.  Born Near Old Capital  Le Duan was born on April 7, 1908, in Quang Tri Province in Central Vietnam just north of the former imperial capital of Hue. Several Central Intelligence Agency biographies complied during the Vietnam War make no mention of a wife or family, but some Vietnamese believe he was married and had a son who flew with the Vietnamese Air Force.  Distinguished by a thick shock of hair and by an open, sturdy countenance, he called himself a peasant but probably came from a literate, land-owning farm family. He was able to get the equivalent of a high school education, relatively rare in that period of French colonial administration.  He became a clerk in the Vietnam Railway Company in Hanoi. With only a tiny proletariat in Vietnam, railway workers were an early organizational target for Moscow-directed party organizers, and Mr. Duan became a zealous Communist in the 1920's.  When anti-French nationalist mutinies and unrest swept much of the country, Mr. Duan was imprisoned in 1930 on Con Son, a penal island off the southern coast. He was released in 1936 when the left-wing Popular Front Government came to power in France.  Jailed During World War  But he was imprisoned again in 1940 by the Vichy authorities in Vietnam and imprisoned at Son La prison in the north until World War II ended.  A member of the party Central Committee, Mr. Duan worked from 1946 onward in what later became South Vietnam, ostensibly as a member of the broad nationalist coalition called the Viet Minh but actually as a Communist organizer and lieutenant of Ho. Cochin China was a relative backwater in the French Indochina war, but Mr. Duan helped put in place a party structure in the south that could not be eradicated by the non-Communist Government when Vietnam was partitioned in 1954.  In the late 1950's he worked in North Vietnam on agricultural production. He eventually carried through the collectivization of agriculture that had initially led to riots and protests and for which Truong Chin was blamed and briefly expelled from public life.  When active guerrilla war began against the South Vietnamese Government around 1959, Mr. Duan oversaw the formation of the People's Revolutionary Party, the Communist ''vanguard party'' of the coalition called the National Liberation Front.  Many Vietnamese and foreign experts on the country believe that Mr. Duan was one of those who argued for the kind of full-scale, implacable prosecution of the war against South Vietnamese and American forces that led to the Tet offensive in 1968 and the final offensive in 1975. In this he was opposed by advocates of a more ''protracted war,'' which was also favored by China.  Broad Role in War  Although Pham Hung created and led the Central Office for South Vietnam, a political and military headquarters situated in the South and Cambodia, Mr. Duan had much broad responsibility for the war. But he seemed to care less for doctrinal, strategic and theoretical arguments than some of his colleagues.  He was close to Ho and read his ''political will'' when the President and party chairman died. The post of chairman was never filled, and Mr. Duan remained the secretary general of the party. Though self-effacing, in Mr. Pike's words, Mr. Duan could not match the avuncular image of ''Uncle Ho'' as a national symbol.  Although he published at least eight books, they were primarily compilations of speeches and reports, and he never achieved a reputation as a party theorist.  ''His main achievement was that he completed the defeat of the South and unification,'' said Stephen Johnson, an expert on Vietnam at the State Department.

"    THE VIETNAMESE GULAG By Doan Van Toai and David Chanoff. Illustrated. 351 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $18.95.  TEN years after the Communists' almost unopposed but dramatic capture of Saigon, the Vietnam War continues to produce shelves of books, mostly written by Americans. Only recently have the Vietnamese begun to write of the war and, perhaps more significant, of its aftermath.  A few Communist authors have published military accounts, notably about the ''Ho Chi Minh campaign,'' which has as its climax Saigon's fall; a considerable number of novels and short stories as well as diaries and essays have appeared in Vietnamese, some of which have been translated. Very few Southerners, however, except for a handful of old-regime officers, have written anything of consequence since they fled Vietnam after April 1975. And even less has come from those who believed in the revolution and initially stayed behind.  This gap is beginning to be filled, and Doan Van Toai's first-person narrative, ''The Vietnamese Gulag,'' done with David Chanoff, who collaborated with Mr. Toai on ''A Vietcong Memoir,'' may be the most important contribution to date. Mr. Toai, a radical student leader jailed several times by the South Vietnamese Government before its defeat, was 30 years old when the war was over. Two months later, on the night of June 22, 1975, he was arrested while attending a concert in downtown Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City). He never makes clear whether his seizure by the bo dois, the Communist military, was the result of mistaken identity - they apparently were after a former anti-Communist student leader named Ngo Vuong Toai - but, mistake or not, Mr. Toai was thrown in jail for ''suspicious acts.''  On Nov. 1, 1977, he was finally released, and five and a half months after that he received permission to leave for France, where his wife and children had gone. Subsequently, the family moved to Berkeley, Calif., where the Toais now live. His account of his long months in Saigon jails is both a horror story and a human one, written with wit, satire, anger and compassion. It is reminiscent, at its best, of E. E. Cummings's ''Enormous Room'' and Arthur Koestler's ''Darkness at Noon.''  Despite the wealth of detail about the miserable life he endured in the two city jails, named after the streets they were on - Tran Hung Dao and Le Van Duyet - Mr. Toai's title is somewhat misleading. He has not written about a ''gulag,'' or a chain of political prisons throughout the country, although such places, sometimes lumped together with ''re-education camps,'' are known to exist. The Vietnamese admit to holding 8,000 to 10,000 prisoners -the State Department claims the real figure may be four or five times higher - but no one knows how many additional former regime members, including army officers, government officials, and private citizens accused of a variety of nonpolitical crimes, are still being kept in a dozen or more camps in remote areas of the countryside. Initially, several hundred thousand were believed to have been ''sent up for re-education,'' and while many have been released, many others have never been seen or heard from, some are known to have died, and the majority have been made to do harsh agricultural labor.  Mr. Toai's father was a longtime member of the Vietminh, precursors of the Vietcong, in the Mekong Delta. His son makes clear from the outset that as a student in Saigon he himself quickly became a sympathizer of the National Liberation Front, formed in 1960, but that he never joined the N.L.F. or the Communist Party. He was, in fact, a self-styled attentiste, defining one who waits because he can't make up his mind. Even when he was serving as a contact man for the N.L.F. while working as a banker, he writes: ''Before the overmastering complexity of events, I had remained indecisive. 'Wait,' I had told myself. 'Buy time, and eventually the situation will clarify itself.' . . . Most of all, I had wanted the revolution to justify my indecisiveness - to reveal itself finally as complex and ambivalent, but in essence good and constructive.''  During several interrogations in prison, though he is never officially told why he was arrested or held for so long, Mr. Toai is, in fact, accused by his questioners of being unable to ''commit himself.'' Being a sympathizer was not enough. Being a prisoner, however, including periods in isolation, turns out to be the best education he ever received, and much of it comes from veteran party members with whom he exchanges whispering conversations and confidences. If he manages to talk himself into being a doctor's aide, a kitchen worker and a barber, in each case he has more leeway, more opportunity to find out what is going on around him. His brash behavior, for which he is frequently chastised or physically punished, eventually also leads to his freedom. One feels the Communists simply wanted to get rid of him, vaguely hoping he might somehow still be of service to them, particularly abroad.  Following his release, Mr. Toai indeed travels to France and then to the United States, but no longer as a sympathizer. He sees himself as ''the first articulate messenger from the new order, and one, moreover, who had experienced its working in his flesh.'' He concludes: ''I knew that my anger was in part due to the cold-blooded way in which the revolution had victimized my ideals. . . . Now I understood it was not that my motives had been wrong, but that my understanding had been woefully incomplete. The passion of my ideals had led me down a trail at whose unforeseen end lay terror and destitution for the nation.'' MR. TOAI credits the Vietnamese Communists with successfully developing ''people's war'' techniques unique to Communist movements, based as they were on Ho Chi Minh's ''finely honed sense of human psychology and almost preternatural guile'' as well as his intimate knowledge of Marxism and Stalinism. In his final mea culpa, Mr. Toai warns that these techniques should be ''studied with the greatest care by the world's democracies and the world's emerging nations, for whom the Communist road to national liberation is in fact a road to national desolation.''  As an apostate's story, Mr. Toai's book falls into a not unfamiliar genre. Its value derives from his having been one of the first Vietnamese to write effectively of his experience, and to describe what he calls ''the method of the betrayal'' of his revolutionary hopes and ideals.  Shortly before he leaves prison, Mr. Toai has a final talk with his closest mentor, a veteran party man, whose doom was sealed when he ran afoul of the system. He is admonished to ''be careful'' and is told, ''You have to stay alive, so you can tell our story one day. It's over for me. . . . All I can do is try to keep my dignity.''  ''The Vietnamese Gulag'' is, according to the title page, ''based on the English translation from the French by Silvie Romanowski and Francoise Simon-Miller''; in this version, it is indeed well written and graphically told, though with more indignation and injured pride than dignity. Having bought a different kind of time, he is purged of his attentiste predilections. But like many Vietnamese now in the United States and elsewhere, he admits to ''a longing to return'' to Vietnam, knowing that ''to live in a land that will always be half alien, with our children who belong to this land as much as they belong to us, that is the burden of our failure.''

"   , Thailand, July 14   A 79-year-old official with a reputation as an ideological hard-liner was chosen today to succeed Le Duan as Vietnam's Communist Party leader, the official Hanoi radio announced, The post is the most important political office in Vietnam.  The new Vietnamese leader, Truong Chinh, had been the second-ranking party Politburo member after Mr. Duan, who died last Thursday. Mr. Chinh is also the State Council Chairman, a position roughly equivalent to a ceremonial president.  In the 1950's, after North Vietnam gained independence from France, Mr. Chinh led an attempt at sweeping land redistribution that historians say may have resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Vietnamese. In the 1960's, Mr. Chinh was among those who advocated sending North Vietnamese forces to fight in the South.  In June, diplomats based in Hanoi said they understood that Mr. Chinh had already assumed some, if not all, of the powers of Mr. Duan, whose health was rapidly deteriorating.  Reported in Failing Health  Mr. Chinh, who is also reported to be in failing health, is expected to remain in office only until the end of the year, when it is expected that the sixth party congress will name a new generation of leaders, the first such sweeping change in Vietnam's post-colonial history.  Mr. Duan's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in Hanoi. According to Vietnamese diplomats in Bangkok, only Laos, Cambodia and the Soviet Union will be represented at a high government level. Foreign journalists have been barred from covering the funeral.  The Vietnamese said Moscow's delegation to the funeral would be led by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzkhov, not the party leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Under Mr. Duan's leadership, the Vietnamese party maintained close relations with Moscow.  This evening, Vietnam's Southeast Asian neighbors heard the news of Mr. Chinh's promotion from Tass, the Soviet press agency, before it was announced by Hanoi. Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, was in Moscow over the weekend, and it was unclear if had returned to Hanoi.  Little Speculation by Diplomats  Asian and Western diplomats in Southeast Asia are being very cautious in predicting what kind of new leadership Vietnam may choose this year. Hanoi remains one of the most secretive capitals in which to work, ambassadors based there say.  Outside Vietnam, there has been a tendency to look for a loosening of ideology and a movement toward change, particularly in the Vietnamese economy, which is in shambles even by Vietnamese assessments.  In June, radio broadcasts from Hanoi were reporting that Le Duc Tho, who negotiated the peace agreements with Henry A. Kissinger that led to American withdrawal from Vietnam, was charging that some party officials were guilty of ''corruption, bribery, smuggling, enrichment, dissoluted and depraved living'' and ''adopting a vulgar lifestyle.''  Diplomats and scholars who have been observing Vietnam over many years suggest that Hanoi's statements, often reflecting pronouncements under Mr. Gorbachev's leadership in Moscow, seem to be calling for a ''renovation'' rather than a ''reform'' of the Marxist-Leninist economic system.  No Sign of Major Change  There has been little official indication in the Vietnamese party press that anything as sweeping as Chinese-style innovations will occur in Vietnam. Rather, the official publications, led by the Communist Party daily Nhan Dan, have harshly criticized the bureaucracy and the labor force for failing to make the present system function efficiently.  Since 1979, Vietnam has instituted a series of economic changes designed, the party journals say, to reinvigorate the economy by allowing a certain amount of individual initiative to dictate agricultural and some industrial production.  But the country's leadership has been ambilvalent about how much private enterprise to allow. This has led to radical swings back and forth, from tolerance to suppression, of small ventures like restuarants and shops, the proprietors say. Taxes have been alternately encouraging and punitive.  The result has been a cynicism, increasingly boldly voiced, among ordinary Vietnamese, coupled with a lack of confidence in the country's currency. For many transactions, the American dollar has become the standard of exchange.  Some Economic Officials Out  In June, at least eight officials involved in the managing of the economy were dismissed, including a Deputy Prime Minister, To Huu. Left in place were several people considered economic pragmatists, led by Vo Van Kiet, the country's economic planner.  But diplomats say that until a new party leadership is in place - later this year at the earliest - it would be premature to predict the direction Hanoi will take in future economic development.  The country is now almost entirely dependent on the Soviet bloc, whose aid has done little to improve the standard of living of the Vietnamese people. Eastern European and Western diplomats in Hanoi say it is an open secret that Vietnam wants better ties with the West, including the United States, because of the developmental expertise such ties might unlock.  But all such links are now blocked by the Vietnamese occupation of neighboring Cambodia and, in the case of the Reagan Administration, a failure on Hanoi's part to resolve to American satisfaction the cases of servicemen missing in action since the Vietnamese War.

"    A group of Vietnam veterans who marched from Washington arrived yesterday at Grant's Tomb for a vigil for 2,400 Americans still missing in Southeast Asia.  Fewer than three dozen veterans made the full march, and only about 100 people greeted them upon their arrival in Manhattan - far fewer than the 1,000 organizers had hoped to draw.  ''There's only a small amount of us who care, but we do care, and we care a lot,'' said Anthony Torres, march organizer for the New York-New Jersey POW-MIA committee. ''People saw us marching. Truck drivers saw us. This is about public awareness.''  Outside the monument, the marchers and their supporters gathered a half-block from a row of tents where many said they planned to stay in a 24-hour vigil.  They expressed a mixture of frustration and hope that prisoners of war and Americans missing in action would eventually be returned to the United States.

"      The White House announced today that Vietnam had released a United States Army veteran who set sail from the Philippines 16 months ago in an attempt to bring out a Vietnamese woman.  The Vietnam War veteran, Robert Schwab 3d of Atlanta, arrived tonight in Bangkok, Thailand, where he will undergo medical tests, Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said. It was unclear when Mr. Schwab, who is 44 years old, will return to the United States.  ''I'm overjoyed,'' Mr. Schwab's father, Robert Schwab Jr., said in Atlanta. The senior Mr. Schwab received a phone call from his son at 3 A.M. today ''Before that,'' he said, ''we thought he was dead.''  Mr. Schwab's stepfather, Robert Davis, who is vacationing in Blue Hill, Me., said the veteran was ''an intellect, an idealist, a sportsman, an adventurer and an author.'' He said Mr. Schwab was a 1963 graduate of Williams College who was ''deeply involved in Vietnam and Thailand'' through the 1970's and early 1980's.   Family Gets Diary  He sailed for Vietnam from the Philippines in April 1985, according to his father and aunt, Nann Pendergast, both of Atlanta. His purpose, they said, was to bring out a Vietnamese woman named Mai and complete research on a book about Vietnam.  Mrs. Pendergast said in an interview that the family knew nothing about the trip for more than two months, when they received a 60-page diary from a Philippine friend of the younger Mr. Schwab in July 1985.  ''He had told us he was going hiking in the Philippine jungle and wouldn't be near a phone for a while,'' Mrs. Pendergast said. ''But he left the diary with a friend and told him to send it to us if he wasn't back in two months.''  The diary described Mr. Schwab's meticulous preparation for a 1,000-mile journey in a sailboat across the China Sea. And it told of his fears.  ''The true hero would be a little scared and a lot excited,'' Mr. Schwab Jr. wrote in the diary, according to Mrs. Pendergast. ''I am the reverse.''  The diary also told of his desire to persuade the Vietnamese authorities to allow a Vietnamese woman he had met years before emigrate to the United States, Mrs. Pendergast said.  An Adventurer, Aunt Says  He had apparently met the woman while he was in the United States Army Signal Corps in Vietnam in the late 1960's, she said. ''We think he had stayed with her family while he was over there,'' she said. ''We have her picture. She's beautiful. She was not his girlfriend, in fact she was much younger than he was. But they had kept up a correspondence over the years.''  Mr. Schwab was a freelance writer and ''very much an adventurer,'' said his aunt. He was working on a book about Vietnam when he left, she said. ''He said he wanted to write the last chapter. Really I think he thought about all of this in terms of his getting material.''  There was no word today from White House officials on the fate of the Vietnamese woman. Mr. Speakes said details about her were ''a private matter.''  Search Efforts 'Useless'  United States officials had been notified by Mr. Schwab's family in June 1985 that he was missing, Mr. Speakes said. ''Normal search and rescue efforts were fruitless, as were inquiries to governments in the region by the Department of State,'' he said.  The White House announcement said that ''given the President's strong interest in all missing Americans,'' Richard Childress, director of Asian affairs for the National Security Council, was ordered to pursue the case with Vietnamese officials in Hanoi and New York. Mr. Childress did so for nearly a year, Mr. Speakes said.  Another White House spokesman, Dan Howard, said: ''Nobody else thought he was alive. The general assumption was that he was at the bottom of the South China Sea, and we kept following up and kept following up. Got the man back.''  Mr. Howard said Mr. Schwab ''came out alone'' from Ho Chi Minh City without the woman. He was accompanied by Mr. Childress. There were no details about where Mr. Schwab had been detained or how the Vietnamese had treated him.  According to Ann Mills Griffith, the executive director of the National League of M.I.A.-P.O.W. Families, Mr. Schwab worked for the organization in the late 1970's. She described him as ''intelligent'' and ''idealistic.''  Mr. Schwab served two tours of duty in Vietnam in the 1960's, she said, and remained in Vietnam from 1967 until 1975, when the Saigon Government collapsed. During this time as a civilian, he worked for several relief agencies, Mrs. Griffiths said.  According to Mrs. Pendergast, the family had no idea for more than a year if Mr. Schwab had even survived his boat trip.  ''His trip is the same trip that the boat people take, only going the other way,'' she said. ''It's very dangerous.''  Then came the 3 A.M. phone call from the American Embassy in Thailand, although the family had been told by United States officials about a month ago that he might be alive.  ''We just can hardly wait to see him,'' Mrs. Pendergast said.  VIETNAM REPORTS CONFESSION  BANGKOK, Thailand, Aug. 14 (Special to The New York Times) - According to the Vietnamese Government radio, Mr. Schwab confessed to violating Vietnam's criminal code and was released only after vowing never to repeat the crime. Until today, Vietnam had never publicly acknowledged that he was in custody.  A team of American military officers from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii is in Hanoi for technical talks with the Vietnamese on further searches for remains of missing Americans. It is not clear whether the release was timed to coincide with their visit.  Mr. Childress said at a news conference in Bangkok last month that Hanoi had promised encouraging news at the August technical session.  According to Alan Dawson, United Press International's bureau chief in Saigon in 1975, Mr. Schwab became a hero of the rushed evacuation that occurred as the city was falling to the North Vietnamese. ''He and some friends helped get out thousands of people when the Ambassador was still refusing permission to evacuate,'' U.P.I. quoted Mr. Dawson as saying. Mr. Schwab had a 17-foot plywood sailing dory built, which he stocked with jugs of water, a plastic sextant and three small radio transmitters, according to friends. They said they had last heard from him on April 18.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: photo of Robert Schwab 3d (AP)                      ",August 14 1986 ,0
"   , Thailand, Aug. 15   A 44-year-old American who calls himself a ''scholar-adventurer'' said at a news conference here today that he deliberately sailed a small boat into Vietnamese waters 16 months ago hoping to be noticed, so he could beg the authorities for help in releasing a Vietnamese woman he wanted to marry.  The American, Robert Schwab 3d, who has also made several illegal forays into Laos to search for missing American servicemen since 1975, said his most recent escapade was intended to capture the imagination of Hanoi.  ''I had to do something dramatic to impress the Vietnamese,'' he said. He said he had also intended to attract worldwide news coverage.  He acknowledged that three of his Laotian adventures had been paid for by ABC News.  Mr. Schwab said that he had planned ''an observed innocent arrival in broad daylight'' in Vietnam, but that his plans had been thwarted when he was detained by Vietnamese fishing vessels before reaching shore.  He was arrested on suspicion of espionage and jailed in central Vietnam, later being held in solitary confinement in the south for more than a year.  The Reagan Administration, which announced Mr. Schwab's release, has been involved in the case at a high level since June 1985.  Mr. Schwab was handed over Thursday in Ho Chi Minh City to Richard K. Childress, Asian affairs director of the National Security Council, who brought him to Bangkok in a United States Air Force plane. Mr. Childress had been negotiating for Mr. Schwab's release since July 1985.  Mr. Schwab said that although he was physically well treated during his imprisonment, he was subjected to ''terrific mental pressure'' and could elicit no information from his captors.  ''They are like a black hole in space,'' he said. ''It sucks everything in and nothing comes out.''  He was never allowed to see the woman he said he went to get - whom he pseudononymously referred to as ''Mai'' - or to discuss her case.  Mr. Schwab, who is from Atlanta, has spent most of the last 20 years in Southeast Asia, starting with a year of military duty in Vietnam in the 1960's. That was followed by various private-agency and quasi-governmental jobs.  Mr. Schwab said today that he met ''Mai,'' who is now about 31, at a coffee shop in Kontum, in the Vietnamese highlands, in 1972 or 1973. He did not suggest marriage until the South was collapsing militarily in 1975, he said. He ruled out taking her out with him, however, when she cried uncontrollably at the thought of leaving her family.  Mr. Schwab said he did not think again about seeing her until a refugee in Thailand told him five years ago that she had had a nervous collapse.  Mr. Schwab said he had a boat built in the Philippines for his trip to Vietnam. Before leaving, he said he prepared a publicity campaign and wrote a letter to the United States Government to be mailed after his departure.  He said he was confident when reaching Vietnam that his plans for publicity had been carried out, and he only gradually realized that they had not. Mr. Childress said no letter ever reached the American Government. The publicity never materialized.  FATHER SAYS $10,000 WAS PAID  ATLANTA, Aug. 15 (AP) - Mr. Schwab's father confirmed today reports from diplomatic sources that a $10,000 fine was paid to Vietnamese officials in order to win the release of his son. Robert Schwab Jr. told The Atlanta Journal that the fine was paid by the younger Schwab's mother, Bunny Davis, and stepfather, Robert Davis.

"   , Thailand, Aug. 16   American experts trying to account for Americans reported missing in the Vietnam War investigated sites in Hanoi last week containing wreckage of B-52 bombers, the leader of the United States team said on his return here today.  The official, Lieut. Col. Joe Harvey, commander of the United States Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Honolulu, said the Vietnamese provided new information on missing Americans and a report of their continuing investigations during three days of talks in Hanoi. He declined to elaborate.  Colonel Harvey refused to say whether Vietnam would soon repatriate remains of some of the nearly 1,800 American troops and civilians listed as missing from the war.  He said the United States team handed over new information on cases of missing Americans and on reports that Americans have been seen in Vietnam since the war.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 7   Vietnamese and United States negotiators failed to reach an agreement on an American request to be allowed to resume interviewing Vietnamese who want to settle in the United States, sources said today.  In a two-day meeting in Hanoi last month, the two sides tried to resolve conflicts over the Orderly Departure Program, a United Nations-sponsored program in which Vietnamese leave Vietnam for resettlement abroad.  Vietnam halted United States interviews of new applicants on Jan. 1, saying the United States has interviewed but not yet resettled thousands of Vietnamese already granted permission to leave. Vietnamese who were interviewed and accepted earlier continue to leave Vietnam, but the number of emigrants has declined sharply since interviewing was halted.  The United States, the largest resettlement country, has taken more than 45,000 Vietnamese under the program, which was established in 1979 to provide an alternative to the dangerous exodus by boat.

About 40 people spent time in the cage at some point in the vigil, which which began Aug. 13 and ended on National P.O.W.-M.I.A. Recognition Day.  Gary Wetzel, a Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam who was the last person in the cage, called on President Reagan and Congress to continue the fight to bring home those who died and any who may still be held in Southeast Asia.  Mr. Wetzel said Wisconsin Vietnam Vets Chapter 1, the sponsoring organization, had collected more than 3,000 signatures on a petition to Hanoi urging the return of any servicemen or civilians still in Vietnam and information on the remains of those still missing.

"    VIETNAMESE cuisine is slowly making itself known in this country - and high time, too. Using many of the by now familiar ingredients of its Chinese neighbor, Vietnamese cooking has its own special distinction, a refreshingly sharp clarity that is unique.  The Truc Orient Express in Hartford summarizes the fresh piquancy of Vietnamese cooking exceptionally well. Although it is one of a mere four Vietnamese restaurants in Connecticut, the name is better known in Massachusetts, where members of the Duong family have established a Truc Orient Express in West Stockbridge and in Springfield.  With minimal decor, the restaurant manages to convey in its four compact dining rooms a fragile sense of the Far East. This is accomplished through the rattan chairs and glass-topped rattan tables, cool green cloths that suggest bamboo and a few lacquer and mother-of-pearl pictures on the walls. Genial, accommodating service contributes to a pleasant experience.  The attractive menu, with a rendering of bamboo on a cream-colored background, gives careful and accurate explanations of the Vietnamese dishes, which range from 6 soups and 6 appetizers to 20 entrees, as well as a vegetarian menu with 6 entrees. The major components range from shrimp, squid and fish to beef, chicken, duck and pork. There is surely something for almost every taste.  What pleased and surprised us on our visits to the Truc Orient Express were the subtle but assertive seasonings, the skillful use of hot pepper, pepper oil and garlic to underscore, but not overpower, a dish. Cha gio truc dac biet, for instance, consisted of two jumbo shrimp rolled in a generous filling of chopped crabmeat, pork and black mushrooms. It was wrapped inside a crisply deep-fried rice batter. An accompanying dip was nuoc mam, an essential companion to Vietnamese food. Clear and pungent, it was a distilled mix of vinegar, chili peppers, garlic, fish sauce, lemon grass, onion and vinegar.  Another appetizer was the unusual goi ga, a platter of shredded cabbage, carrots and onions tossed with chicken bits, grapefruit segments and sesame seeds in a delicate vinegar sauce. Try also canh ga don thit, boneless chicken wings stuffed with chicken and black mushrooms and served with nuoc mam as a light dip. In each case, the fresh ingredients speak for themselves, with emphasis added by a peppery undercurrent.  Among the many satisfying entrees, canh chua tom was particularly winsome. Described as hot-and- sour shrimp soup, it was that, but much more at the same time. Three jumbo shrimp shared a peppery clear broth with plump straw mushrooms and shreds and leaves of lemon grass. The lemon-accented broth also spoke softly of chili pepper.  Equally appealing was nam chua ngot, a vegetarian dish consisting of crisply deep-fried whole straw mushrooms in a thin, delightfully sharp, well-balanced sweet and sour sauce. This garlic, tomato, onion and vinegar sauce was light, with nuances of spicing - not even a distant relative of the more familiar glutinous version.  All the vegetarian dishes were winners: tau hu kho, ''red cooked caramelized tofu,'' served with bamboo-shoot slivers and tomato; banh xeo, ''happy pancake,'' a rice wrapper around fresh mushrooms, onions and bean sprouts with nuoc mam sauce, and ta hu xao chay, sauteed bean curd with straw mushrooms and vegetables.  Appealing nonvegetarian dishes are almost too numerous to mention. Note especially ga xoi mo, five-spice Cornish hen in a blend of saucing; ga sot chua ngot, sweet and sour chicken, and lau thap cam-chap pin loo, a Vietnamese version of Mongolian hot pot, made with chicken, all kinds of seafood and veggies in a hot broth. Only muc xao mang -squid strips with bamboo shoots, tomato, carrots and onion - disappointed in its blandness.  Desserts are Western and minimal. The caramelized flan was exceptionally good, but the lemon mousse, despite welcome slivers of zest, had a prefabricated flavor. At meal's end, try the refreshing, earthy ginseng tea.  Not the least of the surprises at the Truc Orient Express are the prices. A three-course dinner for two cost us $30, with tax, tip and beverages extra. For diners anywhere in the Hartford vicinity who want something different, this small sleeper of a restaurant can be a delightful surprise.

"      Efrain Martinez remembers well the stormy spring evening in 1980 that he locked Gene Fisher and Nguyen Van Nam together in a room at the Holiday Inn in Seabrook, Tex.  It was the beginning of the shrimping season, and like the clouds gathering over Galveston Bay, conflicts between American and Vietnamese fishermen along the Gulf Coast were growing increasingly ominous. The focus of the hostility was on the two men, leaders of rival fishermen's associations.  ''Colonel Nam brought a couple of bodyguards, but they had to wait downstairs,'' recalled Mr. Martinez, who is a Justice Department conciliator. ''And Fisher had some guy calling him every 15 minutes to make sure he was safe.  ''But they sat there face to face for two hours and got an agreement worked out, even exchanged phone numbers. They had been talking about each other for months through the media, but that night they started to understand each other as persons.''  Sessions on Problems Set  In a similar way the uneasy assimilation of Vietnamese immigrants into Texas is softening into the tolerance that comes with time, familiarity and economic reality.  But a growing Vietnamese minority is presenting new challenges for the police and social agencies. Monday and Tuesday, police officials and Asian American leaders from 15 Gulf Coast cities will meet in New Orleans to form a multistate network to address problems of crime and communication.  ''The shrimpers' problems of six and seven years ago aren't as prevalent,'' said Mr. Martinez, one of the organizers of the conference. ''But difficulties are continuing and emerging with delivery of police services to Asians.''  The relative isolation of the immigrant community, with a far different culture from the surrounding majority population, is at the heart of the problem. As the population rises, so does crime, and it tends to stay within the community. Further, both the police and Vietnamese leaders say, the inclination among residents is to try to deal with the problem themselves rather than go outside, to the police.  It was the same isolation that led to the shrimpers' problems, a dramatic clash of cultures in which a white fisherman was killed and dozens of Vietnamese boats were burned. But a relatively swift transformation occurred, in part because of economic necessity. In Palacios, a fishing town on the Gulf Coast, only one fish processing plant used to buy from Vietnamese. Now they all do; they would have no business otherwise.  ''It's a whole system of trying to do things better, cheaper, and with a lot of determination,'' Mr. Martinez said of the Vietnamese newcomers, who are now building their own boats, and venturing farther out into the Gulf, once the domain of corporate fishing operations. ''They kind of used their cultural system and processes and superimposed them on our system. In some cases they superseded our system.''  A Grudging Acceptance  Hence a grudging acceptance by old Gulf Coast hands. ''I can't say the Americans and Vietnamese are drinking buddies,'' said Emery Waite, the only non-Vietnamese left in the fish processing business in Seabrook. ''In my slip, Americans and Vietnamese tie up together and joke around. But when you know their desire is to put you out of business, you're only cordial up to a point.''  In the city, the growing Vietnamese community is no longer the monolith it once was. The first immigrants, who came a decade ago after the fall of Saigon, were generally well-educated and familiar with the West. Among them a younger generation is emerging in force.  ''There is a clear, distinguishable young Asian professional class in Houston,'' said Lan Nguyen, a 26-year-old lawyer, ''which will become a large percentage of the bigger community and which will be a part of the decision-making group of American society.'' Ms. Nguyen says she plans to run for political office in the future.  Political participation is remote, though, for later immigrants, mostly poor boat people who had no head start on assimilation and must concentrate on survival.  Hostility and Violence  Houston's devastated economy has caused additional difficulties. In the last few months, community leaders estimate, ''a few thousand'' Vietnamese have moved to Dallas to look for work. Most of that city's approximately 20,000 Vietnamese have settled, along with refugees from Cambodia and Laos, in ''Little Asia'' on the east side, where they contend with hostility from other residents, who are mostly of Hispanic descent. They are also victimized by the violent gangs of young Vietnamese who prey upon their fellow immigrants almost exclusively.  ''We are seeing an increase in organized Vietnamese criminal activity,'' said Ron Cowart, an officer with the Dallas Police Department who operates a storefront station in Little Asia. ''We're getting a lot of the problems Houston has had for a while now.''  But he is not inclined to dwell on impossibilities. His Little Asia station -an outreach effort that has been widely praised - is more like a community center, with its Boy Scout troops, Buddhist meeting room and job referral bulletin board.  Down the street, Mr. Linh is commuting from Houston to run a new multicultural refugee assistance center. He described his ''mission impossible'' as trying to persuade women in poor Cambodian families to go against tradition and seek work.  ''Oh, well,'' he said wearily. ''Who knows? All kinds of strange things happen in Texas.''

"   , Thailand, Jan. 1   A six-day session of Vietnam's National Assembly ended in Hanoi on Monday without the naming of new Government leaders. No explanation was given by the official Vietnamese news organizations for the absence of expected Cabinet changes.  A Vietnamese News Agency account of the session said only that the assembly had approved a draft law on marriage and the family, adopted development and budget plans for 1987 - including a call for a 7 percent economic growth rate - and welcomed a Soviet call for a nuclear-free world.  On Dec. 17, in the largest shake-up in party history, four prominent Communist leaders resigned or were dropped from the party Politburo during the sixth national Vietnamese Communist Party Congress. It was assumed by scholars and diplomats, as well as by some Vietnamese officials interviewed by journalists, that the former Politburo members would also lose their Government positions when the National Assembly met.  Most Western journalists have been barred from reporting in Vietnam during the last few months.  Resigned at Congress  The leaders holding concurrent high party and governmental positions who resigned during the party congress were Pham Van Dong, the country's Chairman of the Council of Ministers, or Prime Minister, and Truong Chinh, the party's General Secretary and Chairman of the State Council, or President of Vietnam. Mr. Chinh was replaced as party General Secretary by Nguyen Van Linh.  Le Duc Tho, a veteran party leader, also retired Dec. 17, and To Huu, a former deputy Prime Minister, was quietly dropped from the Politburo. Mr. Huu had already lost his Government job in a shake-up last June.  In addition, Gen. Van Tien Dong, the country's Defense Minister, lost his Politburo seat during the party congress. Vietnamese exiles say he or members of his family may have been involved in corruption scnadals. He was also associated with the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.  Vietnamese officials say new Government appointments can be made at any time. Some scholars believe they may come when there is less public attention focused on national meetings, or they could be postponed until June 1987, when a new assembly is due to be convened.  Speculation Over Divisions  There is considerable speculation that continuing divisions in the party are holding up the formation of a new government.  According to the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, the new Politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party, from whom the Government officials are likely to be named, is as follows:  Full members in order of rank are Nguyen Van Linh, Pham Hung, Vo Chi Cong, Do Muoi, Vo Van Kiet, Le Duc Anh, Nguyen Duc Tam, Nguyen Co Thach, Dong Si Nguyen, Tran Xuan Bach, Nguyen Thanh Binh, Doan Khue and Mai Chi Tho. There is one alternate member, Dao Duy Tung.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 2 1987 ,1
"    THE PALACE FILE By Nguyen Tien Hung and Jerrold L. Schecter. Illustrated. 542 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $22.95.  WRITTEN largely from a Saigon perspective, this book provides significant new data on United States relations with South Vietnam from 1968 to 1975 and fresh insights into the character of Nguyen Van Thieu, the general whom the United States supported as South Vietnam's President from 1967 to 1975. An extraordinary collection of previously undisclosed exchanges of letters between Mr. Thieu and Presidents Nixon and Ford combine with the authors' interviews with many key Americans and Vietnamese to make this an important study.  Nguyen Tien Hung, an American-trained economist who currently teaches at Howard University, was with the International Monetary Fund before being appointed special assistant to President Thieu in 1973. He later became Minister of Economic Development and Planning and one of Mr. Thieu's closest advisers. Jerrold Schecter, author of an earlier book on Vietnam, ''The New Face of Buddha,'' covered Vietnam for Time magazine in the early 1960's; from 1971 to 1975 he was the magazine's White House correspondent and then its diplomatic editor.  The authors of ''The Palace File'' establish that a reluctant Mr. Thieu was induced to support the 1973 Paris accords, which for Americans ended the Vietnam War, because of Mr. Nixon's repeated private promises that the United States would punish North Vietnam with heavy bombing if it significantly violated the agreements, and by his clear threat that American economic support might end if the South Vietnamese President refused to sign them. ''For President Thieu and his government, the real agreement in Paris was not what had been signed . . . with North Vietnam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government, but the private promises Nixon had made in his letters to Thieu ever since December 1971.'' Mr. Nixon's commitment, and Mr. Ford's somewhat less explicit private assurances, led Mr. Thieu to believe that despite the mounting antiwar mood in Congress the White House could still be counted on to back up the Paris accords with United States air and naval power.  The authors persuasively present a charge of duplicity, directed primarily against former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, but also implicating Mr. Nixon and ultimately Mr. Ford, who, with his eye on the 1976 election, shied away from greater assistance to Mr. Thieu for fear of ''making it his war instead of Nixon's.'' Mr. Thieu was especially bitter toward Mr. Kissinger: ''If Kissinger had the power to bomb the Independence Palace to force me to sign the [Paris] agreement, he would not hesitate to do so.''  Mr. Thieu had assumed Mr. Nixon was in his debt for his help in getting Mr. Nixon elected in 1968, for he had refused President Johnson's request to participate in negotiations with Hanoi, thereby undercutting Vice President Humphrey's efforts to present himself as a man of peace who could end the war through negotiation. The authors show that Mr. Thieu made a major mistake in his reliance on Mr. Nixon and Mr. Ford and in his fear that he would antagonize them if he released their letters, incorporating their firm commitments, to Congress and the American public, even after Hanoi had begun its 1975 offensive. But they do not provide the facts to warrant their assertion: ''The weight of the evidence shows that had the United States kept the promises made in writing to Thieu to convince him to sign the Paris Accords, the Republic of South Vietnam could have survived.''  Even if after 1973 Congress had restored earlier levels of economic support and military supplies and agreed to punitive United States bombing of the north, it is doubtful Mr. Thieu's regime could have been shored up much longer. There was too much wrong with it. Sotto voce, the authors acknowledge its weakness - an ineffective, repressive government artificially sustained from the outset by massive American economic support and military supplies, honeycombed with corruption and led by a man whose popular support was so weak that he perceived his ''mandate from heaven'' as issuing predominantly from Washington. Having earlier helped overthrow Ngo Dinh Diem in an American-supported coup, Mr. Thieu constantly worried that his fate might be similar if Washington became dissatisfied with his own stewardship. THE book treats the Washington-Hanoi dimension of the Paris accords and the negotiations leading up to them less comprehensively than it treats the Washington-Saigon level, and there are some serious inaccuracies in this treatment. For example, the authors write, ''Hanoi scorned aid offered by the U.S. to 'heal the wounds of war.' '' Indeed, in order to consummate the negotiations, Mr. Nixon felt obliged to offer Hanoi $3.25 billion in reconstruction aid, and that offer - though never implemented - was certainly not scorned.  As for the 1973 accords, the authors conclude: ''Although Kissinger made it appear that the North Vietnamese had made concessions, in fact it was the U.S. which totally backed down on all major issues.'' As one of his aides referred to the Christmas bombings: ''We bombed them into accepting our concessions.'' And what did the Nixon Administration actually accomplish? ''During the nearly four years Kissinger negotiated for an agreement, the bloodshed mounted: 15,000 Americans were killed and 100,000 Americans wounded while hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese lives were lost.'' In the end, Mr. Kissinger ''arrived at an agreement that was essentially the same as the one the Communists presented to him in May 1969.'' But he had secured his ''decent interval,'' and Mr. Nixon found it easier to sustain his claim of achieving ''peace with honor.''

The stage was decorated with Vietnam's national colors of red and gold, a map of Vietnam, a banner saying ''To Quoc Tren Het'' or ''Country Above All,'' and two paper dragons -the Vietnamese consider themselves descendants of a dragon.  'We Shall Return'  The organizers wore yellow and red buttons saying ''We Shall Return.''  There were also slogans celebrating the Year of the Cat, a year of love and grace. While the Chinese are honoring what is expected to be the mild and peaceful Year of the Rabbit, the Vietnamese prefer what they call ''a shrewder and more agile creature'' in the form of a great, bulbous cat.  Generally the Chinese and the Vietnamese observe the same sign of the Zodiac representing each year of a 12-year cycle on the lunar calendar. There are three exceptions, with the Vietnamese celebrating the cat, the boar and the water buffalo, while the Chinese honor the rabbit, the pig and the ox.  Vietnamese families from all over the metropolitan region assembled for the Tet celebrations - lasting from noon until midnight - featuring karate, and traditional songs and dances. The program was organzed by eight Vietnamese social, political and cultural organizations that united this year for the first time.  ''We're trying to keep our Vietnamese traditions and adjust to American life at the same time,'' said Rev. Joseph Hien, director of the Vietnamese American Cultural Organization. This agency, located in Manhattan, provides social and educational services to Vietnamese refugees, who are said to number more than 20,000 in the metropolitan area.  On New Year's Day, the main activity for the Vietnamese, like the Chinese, is eating, although the delicacies differ widely, from sauces to cakes, according to the supervisor of the cultural agency, Mary Tuyet Mai. The Vietnamese holiday specialty is Banh Chung, a glutinous rice and meat cake wrapped in banana leaves, while the Chinese prefer dumplings filled with sweet sesame seed paste. Both the Vietnamese and the Chinese consider that the red flesh of watermelon, like red envelopes, brings good luck.

"   , Thailand, Feb. 3   Pressure from grass-roots party organizations forced the sweeping changes in the Vietnamese Communist Party leadership in December, according to a Western diplomat based in Hanoi.  His impressions were supported by a group of American scholars who traveled extensively in Vietnam for two weeks last month. The Americans, taking part in a tour sponsored by the private United States-Indochina Reconciliation Project, heard frequent demands for economic reform and experienced firsthand the bitterness apparently felt by provincial people over Soviet influence in Hanoi.  Village children, shouting ''Russian! Russian!'' in Vietnamese, stoned the Americans on several occasions, according to a member of the group, Mary Byrne McDonnell, Indochina program associate of the Social Science Research Council, an organization based in New York.  The attacks stopped, Ms. McDonnell said, when group members identified themselves as Americans.  An Economic Crisis  Vietnam is facing a severe economic crisis, according to reports in its own Government-controlled press organizations. The Hanoi-based diplomat, who briefed reporters Monday on condition that he not be quoted by name, said projections by international organizations indicate that on an average day, about 60 Vietnamese die of starvation in a country where malnutrition is widespread.  Hanoi, which has been unable to produce or import birth control supplies, faces the prospect that the population, now 60 million, will rise to 100 million by the end of the century, the diplomat said. Without improved agricultural technology, he added, Vietnam will not be able to feed itself.  He said Soviet aid, now between $1 billion and $2 billion a year, mostly in large energy projects, is not addressing Vietnam's most urgent daily needs.  At the same time, Vietnam is expected to provide tropical produce to cold-weather areas of the Soviet Union. A Vietnamese-language broadcast from Moscow on Jan. 15, monitored and translated by the BBC, described the production of green vegetables for the Soviet Far East as ''central'' to Vietnam's agricultural research program.  'Classic Imperialism'  The diplomat characterized the Soviet Union's activities in Vietnam as ''classic imperialism of the kind that Lenin railed about.''  Several diplomats based in Hanoi have said the United States, and the West in general, should be finding ways to assist Vietnam at a time when Western expertise could offer an alternative to complete reliance on the Soviet Union.  The group of American scholars, led by John McAuliff, who is head of the Quaker-supported, Philadelphia-based Reconciliation Project organization, heard repeated requests for American assistance and training, Ms. McDonnell said. Officials cited bans on United States visas for Vietnamese scholars as a major worry. Virtually all Vietnamese technological training takes place in the Soviet bloc.  The United States, which does not have diplomatic relations with Hanoi, has said it will not improve ties until the issue of 2,426 Americans missing in Indochina since the 1970's is resolved. In addition, Washington insists that Vietnam withdraw its 140,000 troops from Cambodia, a demand made also by all other major would-be donor nations, including China.  Links Are Limited  Links between Washington and Hanoi are limited almost entirely to discussions on the missing Americans, and these talks have been sporadic and inconclusive.  The talks have slowed over the last year as Vietnam, according to diplomats, has been preoccupied with carrying out economic and political changes over the objections of ideological hard-liners in the party. The diplomats say the policy is conducted with an eye on China's example, but with care to use the language of Moscow. Most Western reporters have been denied access to the country since last spring.  The Hanoi-based Western diplomat who briefed reporters Monday, and other foreigners living in Vietnam who are familiar with the events leading up to the Vietnamese party congress in December, say a struggle within the leadership over how to respond to an outpouring of public criticism last fall was still going on two days before the congress opened Dec. 14.  Retirements at the Top  On the third day of the congress, it was suddenly announced that three top Communist leaders were retiring from the party Politburo. These were Pham Van Dong, who is also the country's Prime Minister; Truong Chinh, the party General Secretary and President of Vietnam, and Le Duc Tho, the powerful political figure who was Hanoi's negotiator in the Paris peace talks with the United States. Only Mr. Dong, who is 80 years old and very frail, had been expected to withdraw.  In addition, the country's Defense Minister, Gen. Van Tien Dong, and a former Deputy Prime Minister, To Huu, also lost their Politburo seats.  Nguyen Van Linh, a party official with long experience in southern Vietnam and a man thought to be a supporter of economic change and liberalization, was named to replace Mr. Chinh as party leader.  But in a National Assembly session that followed the party congress, the retiring Politburo members retained their Government positions, to the surprise of the Hanoi diplomatic corps. The retiring leaders are now expected to relinquish their Government titles at the next session of the Assembly, next June.  Some diplomats interpret the delay as an acknowledgment of continuing divisions in the party over the next generation of leadership. Other diplomats disagree, saying that this is no more than a graceful way to ease out a generation of heroes who could win wars but had trouble developing a country in peacetime.

"    BIDONG, Malaysia, Feb. 12   The story is best told in Nguyen Van Du's own words.  ''We were all friends,'' Mr. Du said in halting English. ''We discussed it together. Hai said: 'If we don't do this, more will die. It is the only way to save the other passengers.' ''  Mr. Du, Tran Van Hai and 14 others, mostly in their teens and 20's - members of a new generation of Vietnamese boat people venturing into the moody South China Sea - are the survivors of a harrowing monthlong voyage that led to a desperate act of cannibalism.  Theirs was one of two exceptional ordeals in January, refugee officials say. The survivors of both are being cared for by Malaysian and international agencies on this island set aside for Vietnamese plucked from Malaysian seas and beaches.  As the original group of 24 passengers on Mr. Du's drifting boat began to die of starvation, dehydration and exposure, the living decided that they would have to eat the flesh of a dead companion or perish.  They chose survival. Several days later - on about Jan. 5, although their recollection is vague - their boat drifted into Malaysian waters near Desaru, and they were rescued.  A week later, another boat of Vietnamese exiles capsized just before reaching land, drowning 38 of its 68 passengers, several of them children too small to survive the rough seas.  ''When I reached the shore,'' To My Hue said quietly, ''I saw my husband unconscious on the beach. I ran along the sand to find my daughter, my nephew, my sister. They were alive. But I knew that my little son was dead. He was 5. He was too young.''  'And Still They Come'  Beside her on a sitting-room couch her sister, Phuong, wept silently. Mrs. Phuong's husband and 12-year-old son had also died. The capsizing was the second-worst Vietnamese boat tragedy recorded in these waters. In 1978, 154 people drowned near here, also within sight of their goal.  ''And still they come,'' a Malaysian official said. ''And still they come.''  The survivors of both January incidents - Boat 688 and Boat 689 on Malaysian records - have joined more than 9,000 Vietnamese boat people waiting on Bidong for resettlement abroad. At least another 22,000 are in centers in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Macao and China. No one knows how many have died, unrecorded, at sea.  The Malaysian authorities allowed this reporter to meet the weakened and still distressed survivors of Boats 688 and 689 on Bidong, an island normally closed to outsiders, because refugee officials say the world has forgotten the boat people. Each year it is more difficult to find them homes.  A Resurgence of Emigration  There are fears that the number of boat people will rise again this year with the continued suspension of the Orderly Departure Program, a legal process of emigration from Vietnam.  People processed under this program outnumbered illegal emigrants in 1985, but Hanoi halted interviews for the program at the end of that year. Vietnamese previously approved for emigration continued to trickle out of the country legally through 1986, but the tide of illegal emigrants rose again.  Mr. Du described how he and his friends, all from the central Vietnamese seaside town of Nha Trang, planned their escape for a month, using a boat belonging to one of the group who - uncharacteristically in such matters -had charged his accomplices nothing for the trip.  One of the passengers, Mr. Hai, 25 years old, was the son of a former South Vietnamese soldier and said he could not hope for a good job because of his father's past.  Also among the passengers were several students leaving Vietnam because, they said, they thought neither they nor the country had a future. One of them, Huynh Thi Nhu Tram, 19, said that she had talked over her decision with her parents and that they had agreed reluctantly that she should escape.  New Levels of Desperation  ''At Dec. 8 midnight,'' Mr. Du began, ''we got on the boat to go to the Philippines.  ''Three days, and the engine is out. I carry only five days' food and water. On fourth day, I try make a sail from boat wood and nets.  ''Six days. No water. I try boil seawater for steam to drink. I use gasoline for fire. Two more days, no fire, no light.''  Twenty days after the voyage began, according to Mr. Du, a former South Vietnamese soldier and the oldest member of the party, people began jumping overboard. Two, including the boat's owner, thought they could swim to an oil rig. Two others saw fishing buoys and hoped to cling to them, waiting for the fishermen to return. ''They not come back,'' Mr. Du said. By that time, the boat had drifted well off its easterly course for the Philippines and was heading southwest. One passenger began drinking urine. Others drank sea water. ''It stuck to mouth and throat,'' Mr. Du said. ''They choked. They died.''  That was when the survivors made their decision. ''We all eat,'' Mr. Du said. Plan Was Almost Perfect Mrs. Hue's vessel, Boat 689, carried several people who had been trying and failing to escape for nearly a decade. Mrs. Hue, 31, the daughter of a South Vietnamese colonel, had been imprisoned after one escape attempt.  The boat's owner, who drowned with seven members of his family, had bought the vessel six years ago as part of an elaborate plan to make a getaway with the largest possible number of people. Each passenger promised to pay $2,500 on arrival; the amount would be deposited in the United States by relatives who had fled earlier.  The plan was almost perfect. The passengers, all from the Ho Chi Minh City area, made their way to the port of Bac Lieu on the southern Vietnamese coast, where they boarded the boat on Jan. 10. The voyage, Mrs. Hue said, took only 56 hours, almost a record crossing.  ''All of us were very happy,'' Mrs. Hue, who speaks good English, said. ''We thought, we have found freedom.'' Refugee officials say the boat was just off the Malaysian port of Kuala Trengganu, not far from the seaside commercial airport, when the accident happened.  Boat Suddenly Capsized  ''A plane flew over us,'' Mrs. Hue said. ''The boat owner sees it and thinks it is coming from an army airport. He is afraid, and decides to anchor.  ''But the sea is very rough. Just after he puts down the anchor - immediately - the boat turns down.'' She gestured, describing the capsizing. ''I couldn't even talk to my husband or sister. Not one of us had time to say anything.''  Clinging to oil drums, planks and a few life preservers, fewer than half the passengers were swept ashore by the waves.  Were they sorry they had taken this risk?  ''No,'' Mrs. Phuong said, clutching her charity-issue sport dress, more appropriate to a California golf course than a refugee camp.  ''Before we left Vietnam, I understood all the possible dangers,'' she said, her face drawn and stained with tears. ''I wished then that if my family would die, we would all die together.  ''I am sorry that I am the only survivor.''

"      Vietnamese immigrants who have settled in Philadelphia over the last decade have often been silent victims of assault, robbery and extortion by a small gang of Vietnamese youths. But that silence appears to be ending, say the police, who attribute several recent arrests to the cooperation of Vietnamese crime victims.  Police and legal officials say that cultural differences and language barriers have inhibited many Southeast Asian immigrants from reporting crimes. But they say a concerted effort among the police and neighborhood groups is now encouraging Vietnamese residents to come forward.  In one case last December, a month after a gang of young Vietnamese disrupted a crowded dance and stabbed a teen-age Vietnamese boy, informers told the police that gang members would show up at another dance. About 40 police officers and several Federal agents arrived at the dance site in northeast Philadelphia.  ''I wanted to make a big show,'' said Capt. Thomas M. Seamon of the Philadelphia Police Department. ''These gang members had been bragging that the police were afraid of them, so I wanted to make a big show. Since then we've had more cooperation from complainants. They're beginning to see that if we're given information, we won't compromise.''  Language Barrier a Problem  There were no incidents at the dance but the police made six arrests on outstanding felony warrants.  Many community organizers and police representatives attribute the silence to cultural differences and language barriers. ''If you dial 911 and you only speak Cambodian or Vietnamese, you won't be understood,'' said Fernando Chang-Muy, a lawyer with Community Legal Services' Southeast Asian Refugee Project.  The Philadelphia police have no Vietnamese-speaking officers. But in September the department set up a unit to defuse racial incidents throughout the city. Lieut. Marshall Smith, head of the unit, said that with the help of Asian ethnic organizations his officers are finding ''people to translate and to get people to report crimes.''  ''It's the beginning of things being exposed,'' Lieutenant Smith said. ''We're going to get a rise in the number of Asian incidents but that will be connected with the dialogue we can have with the community.''  'A Personal Assault'  Since the 1975 Communist takeover in Vietnam, an estimated 650,000 Southeast Asians have settled in the United States. About 25,000 Vietnamese, Hmong, Cambodian, Laotian, Korean and Chinese immigrants have settled in Philadelphia. In addition to language difficulties and cultural mistrust of police authority, many Southeast Asians have treated victimization as ''a personal assault rather than a crime against the state,'' said Capt. Frank P. Friel, head of the Philadelphia police organized crime intelligence unit. ''It was a lot easier to pay $20 a week to an extortionist than to go to the police.''  As a result, Southeast Asians have been subjected to crimes often described as ''very vicious.'' In one case, Captain Seamon said: ''Five Vietnamese robbed a store owned by a Vietnamese family and terrorized them until they'd say where their money was hidden. They threw the grandmother down the stairs and then stole their car. Two days later two of them were apprehended in Boston. About four months later one was arrested in Chicago, one in New Orleans, and the fifth in Port Arthur, Tex.''  Keeping Track of Gangs  Police departments around the country are keeping in touch when crimes by Vietnamese gangs are reported. Captain Friel believes there is ''a loosely organized structure'' among these gangs, which are often heavily armed. ''They're not a monolithic group but they appear to know each other and have contacts in different places where they can flee to avoid apprehension,'' he said. Philadelphia's gang is estimated to have 12 to 25 members.  In 1985 the President's Commission on Organized Crime found that many of the gangs originated in resettlement camps before moving to cities across the country.  Debbie Wei, a 29-year-old Chinese-American teacher who has taught English to hundreds of Asian youths, said many youths who have ended up as gang members came to the United States as orphans and badly need education and counseling services.  ''These kids were on the streets over there,'' she said. ''They're very tough. They've spent years in refugee camps where you had to steal to survive. The longer they're in refugee camps, the harder they get.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",February 15 1987 ,0
"    MAI, Thailand, Feb. 17   Vietnam reorganized its Government today, replacing the Interior and Defense Ministers along with at least a dozen other officials, according to the Hanoi radio.  Among the new appointments, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach has taken on the additional title of Deputy Prime Minister.  Le Duc Anh, commander of Vietnamese forces in Cambodia, becomes Defense Minister, replacing Gen. Van Tien Dung, who was credited with building the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Laos and Cambodia in the Vietnam War. General Dung was the strategist of the final assault on South Vietnam in the mid-1970's.  The changes announced today come two months after a shake-up in the hierarchy of the ruling Communist Party. That shake-up followed criticism of party and Government officials for inefficiency, corruption and other failures.  City Mayor Is Promoted  In the Government changes announced today, Mai Chi Tho, a former Mayor of Ho Chi Minh City, becomes Minister of the Interior. He replaces Pham Hung, now the second-ranking member of the Politburo, who remains one of the Deputy Prime Ministers.  Prime Minister Pham Van Dong will retain his post, despite his reported pleas to be relieved of his Government responsibilities. Mr. Dong, who is 80 years, old and frail, resigned from the Politburo in December.  In the December changes, Prime Minister Dong was one of three leaders of the Ho Chi Minh generation to resign his Politburo seat. The others were the General Secretary, Truong Chinh, and Le Duc Tho, the negotiator in the peace talks that led to the withdrawal of the United States from Vietnam.  Mr. Chinh, who is also the country's President, was replaced as party leader by Nguyen Van Linh, a man with years of experience in former South Vietnam.  Mai Chi Tho, who was named Interior Minister today, is another high party official with long experience in the South. The brother of Le Duc Tho, he is reported to be a tough internal-security advocate who was trained in the Soviet Union in 1985. New Food Ministry Among other appointments announced today were these:  The Deputy Prime Ministers, in addition to Foreign Minister Thach and Mr. Hung, will be Nguyen Khanh, Ngoc Triu, Tran Duc Luong, Nguyen Van Chinh and Doan Duy Thanh, who will also be responsible for foreign trade.  Nguyen Cong Tan will head a newly created Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries. Hoang Quy will be Finance Minister; Vu Tran, Minister of Light Industry, and Vu Ngoc Hai, Minister of Energy, another newly revamped department. All these ministries are critical to Vietnam's attempts to redirect its faltering economy.  Tran Van Phac becomes Minister of Culture, Pham Minh Hac becomes Education Minister, and Tran Hoan will head a new Information Ministry.  The country's Nationalities Commission, which dealt with minority groups, has apparently been dissolved, the announcement indicated today.  A new Commission for Economic Relations with Foreign Countries has been created. Hanoi has made one of its major goals the building up of exports. It also hopes to attract investment from the the Western industrialized nations.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",February 17 1987 ,1
"    To the Editor:  As do other writings on the events in and about Vietnam from late 1972 to the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, George McT. Kahin's review of ''The Palace File'' by Nguyen Tien Hung and Jerrold L. Schecter (Jan. 18) contains an implicit assumption that the 1975 North Vietnamese offensive was somehow a preordained event quite unrelated to the political situation in the United States. That is not so.  Hanoi's decision to undertake the 1975 offensive and its preliminaries at the end of 1974 was reached after much discussion. The key element was the regime's correct appraisal that the Watergate-induced political situation in Washington would all but insure that the United States in effect abandon South Vietnam. Although our intelligence on the decision-making process in Hanoi was fragmentary, it was clear to us at the Embassy in Saigon in mid-1974 (I was Deputy Chief of Mission there in 1974 and 1975) that the North Vietnamese leadership's assessment of the political situation in the United States figured decisively in their deliberations, and we so advised Washington in August 1974. That this judgment was correct has since been confirmed, notably by the North Vietnamese general, Van Tien Dung, in his book ''Our Great Spring Victory: An Account of the Liberation of South Vietnam.''  President Nixon began his second term in 1973 fresh from an election in which Vietnam policy was a -if not the - major issue. If the Presidency had not been emasculated by Watergate, Hanoi would not have gone for broke as it did in September 1974, and the scenario certainly would have been different.  It would be foolish to assert that, were it not for Watergate, there would today be a viable Republic of Vietnam. It is also wrong to claim, as Mr. Kahin does, that regardless of Watergate and the growing impotence of the Presidency from mid-1973 onward, the eventual outcome would have been the same because of alleged inadequacies of the Thieu Government; these always figured more prominently in the American psyche than they did on the ground, and were also vastly overstated by those in this country determined to advance their own agenda in regard to Vietnam. The truth is that we simply do not know how the pieces of the kaleidoscope would have fit together, had there never been a Watergate.   - WOLF LEHMANN   - Rockville, Md.

"   , Thailand, March 26   In provincial towns all over Vietnam, the Communist Party has been criticizing, purging and punishing errant party workers, according to frank and unusually detailed reports in the Vietnamese press.  Preparing for National Assembly elections on April 19, local organizations have been reporting cases of corruption, abuse of power, embezzlement and expense cheating.  The press accounts, bold even by the standards of non-Communist Southeast Asian countries, confirm reports by Hanoi-based diplomats and visitors to Vietnam, who say the Vietnamese, among the region's poorest and most strictly regulated people, are demanding change at the grassroots.  Problems in the Military  At the same time, the Vietnamese Army newspaper has published accounts recently indicating that the armed forces, involved for the last eight years in a war in Cambodia, are facing serious problems in training, supply and morale.  Recent editorials in the army daily, Quan Doi Nhan Dan, criticized ''paternalistic'' officers who misinform and mistreat recruits. The editorials followed articles late last year calling attention to the poor living conditions of soldiers.  Writing about civilian corruption, the party newspaper, Nhan Dan, recently published a long report on abuses uncovered in Hai Hung Province, a relatively prosperous part of northern Vietnam between Hanoi and the port of Haiphong. Foreign reporters taken to Hai Hung early in 1986 saw thriving markets and private homes and threshing floors under construction. Food seemed abundant, and local leaders were proud of the region's creativity and energy.  Since last fall, however, local party organizations in Hai Hung have been busy investigating and exposing cases of ''negative phenomena,'' according to Nhan Dan. Several party leaders have been taken to court. Early this month, the newspaper reported these findings and official actions:  * ''A number of cadres were criticized for practicing corruption, enjoying special privileges, oppressing the masses, illegally occupying land and possessing houses beyond the prescribed criteria.''  * ''Those cadres and party members who were given special privileges or special rights to buy motorcycles, radios with cassette players and refrigerators at cheap prices have been asked to turn in these goods.''  * ''Truong Van Day, former director of the My Van district foreign trading corporation, made under-the-table deals with bad elements to embezzle large amounts of money and export goods.''  * ''Nguyen Van Tap, a cadre of Chi Linh district, forged documents to misappropriate money belonging to fallen combatants and war invalids. These cadres will soon be exposed before the law.''  * ''The provincial party committee has issued directives to sternly prohibit excessive carousing, gift-giving and granting of awards contrary to policy.''  Debauchery and Drugs  In another report, Quan Doi Nhan Dan, the army paper, described two criminal gangs that had been brought to justice. The first syndicate speculated in commodities, bribing officials with gold. ''Squandering state property, they bought fine houses and cars and engaged in debauchery,'' the newspaper said.  The members of the second gang were Hanoi truck drivers who made regular trips into Laos. ''While on cross-border missions, they brought with them gold, silver and large quantities of goods to Laos to trade for opium,'' the paper said, adding that on an undisclosed date this year, they were caught ''red-handed'' with nearly 340 pounds of narcotics.  Most Western journalists have been barred from Vietnam since last spring, when a long process of political reorganization and ''purification'' began. The changes may not be completed until June, when a new Prime Minister is expected to be named to replace Pham Van Dong, according to Vietnamese officials.  Hanoi's severe economic problems appear to have heightened the complaints and criticisms about the army as it struggles to convert itself from a revolutionary force into a conventional military organization, according to an Australian expert.  The expert, Carlyle A. Thayer, a senior lecturer in politics at the Australian Defense Force Academy and a specialist on Indochina, said the army is being forced to become a constituency - ''a bargaining group competing for a piece of the cake.'' Vietnam has one of the world's largest fighting forces, with 1.1 million regular troops backed by more than 3 million reservists and 1.5 million paramilitary personnel, according to Mr. Thayer.  In a telephone interview from his office in Campbell, Australia, Mr. Thayer said the priority on nonmilitary development had aroused fears among officers that the army might be shortchanged. He said complaints took on a ''poignant'' edge at garrison level.  Recruits Called Unprepared  Many of the recruits are rounded up in what was formerly South Vietnam and sent unprepared into Cambodian battle areas, according to Vietnamese deserters now in Thailand.  In an editorial read on Hanoi's domestic radio on March 11 and translated by the BBC monitoring service, the army newspaper confirmed that recruits ''have failed to adopt habits relevant to the requirements of building a modern, standardized army.''  Several days earlier, the Hanoi radio quoted from an editorial in the same newspaper that urged commanders to pay more attention to suggestions from the ranks.  ''We must keep the masses abreast of the situation,'' it said. ''What about the strengths and weaknesses of the of the unit, the strong points and the shortcomings of the leadership cadres and combatants? How tough are the ordeals to be encountered by the unit ahead?''  Army newspaper articles have also mentioned corruption. It is generally agreed by foreign experts that the dismissal of Gen. Van Tien Dung as Defense Minister in February was related to the business activities of his wife, who had reportedly built up a fortune from corruption and the black market.

"    To the Editor:  The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment has concluded that too few American ground troops in the Vietnam War were exposed to Agent Orange to form a data base to determine if the defoliant caused physiological harm (news story, Sept. 30).  However, an adequate number of people for a data base might be found among Vietnamese who were exposed to the chemical. Given the large quantities of the herbicide that were sprayed on the countryside of Vietnam, there clearly are enough exposed Vietnamese soldiers and civilians to draw on for a study.  Approaching the Vietnamese with such a proposal and an offer to share in the results could also help heal some of the still-festering wounds between our nations.  WILLIAM J.

"      In the 12 years since the fall of Saigon, Bui Diem, South Vietnam's last Ambassador to Washington, has been a bit of a jack-of-all-trades: professor, writer, lecturer and, for one two-year period, a dispenser of pastrami and corn beef at Goldberg's Deli in northwest Washington.  ''I had to find some way to earn my living,'' Mr. Diem recalled. ''We had a young 8-year-old son to whom I had to give an education, and I had to try to forget Vietnam because if you continued to think of it, it would become too depressing.''  His son, Han, is now studying business and computers at the University of Maryland. And Mr. Diem, currently a visiting professor at the Indo-China Institute at George Mason University in Virginia, has written a memoir of the Vietnamese struggle, ''In the Jaws of History,'' published last month by Houghton Mifflin. Written with David Chanoff as co-author, it is one of a handful of books by Vietnamese authors published here.  Two Days Before the Fall  It is a story told by a man who was at center stage. Mr. Diem was a member of the delegation to the 1954 Geneva conference, chief of staff to Prime Minister Phan Huy Quat in 1965, Ambassador to Washington from 1967 to 1972 and Ambassador-at-Large until the end in April 1975.  He had been sent back to Washington by President Nguyen Van Thieu in an unsuccessful, last-ditch lobbying effort on behalf of $700 million in emergency aid that was bottled up in Congress. While here, he had relocated his wife, Kim-Ngoc, his son and two grown daughters, Ngoc-Luu and Ngoc-Giao. On April 17 he returned to a doomed Saigon, flying out again with his 90-year-old mother and sister two days before the city fell to North Vietnam's Coummunist forces on April 30.  The memory is still vivid, said Mr. Diem, 65 years old, as he settled down for an interview at Jean Pierre, a fashionable French restaurant on K Street.  ''I thank you for asking me to come to this place,'' said Mr. Diem as he looked about at the flowers and linen-draped tables. ''I used to come here frequently.''  From Jeers to Questions  As South Vietnam's envoy in Washington he used to do business in such settings with journalists and with such Government figures as William P. Bundy, Philip C. Habib, Robert S. McNamara, Maxwell Taylor and Henry A. Kissinger. Today he lectures to eager young students who, he said, want to understand the Vietnam War.  In the mid-1960's Ambassador Diem was jeered and booed on unversity campuses. Today, students ask him questions.  ''Students are very much interested in understanding why it happened,'' he said. ''They tell me, 'People keep comparing Vietnam with Central America and Korea and the Philippines, but we have no idea about what went on - we have to understand Vietnam before we can compare it with what is going on today.' ''  Like many Vietnamese who came to this country, Mr. Diem lost everything. He fled Saigon, he said, with two suitcases and ''a few thousand dollars.''  ''I went through a very difficult time,'' he said without elaboration. In those first years he supported his family by working on a Vietnam study at the Rand Corporation. In 1979, with Vietnamese friends and borrowed money, Mr. Diem bought into the Goldberg delicatessen on K Street. That proved a bad business venture, he said, and he returned to his writing, lecturing and consulting at the American Enterprise Institute and at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, where he first began work on his memoir.  Mr. Diem, who is now an American citizen and lives in Rockville, Md. in a house ''with a big American mortgage,'' voices little bitterness about the brutal manner in which the United States left Vietnam.  No Passing Chapter  ''Perhaps I still feel the anger deep down, but I restrain from expressing it,'' he said. ''I suppose it is a matter of temperament.''  ''For many Americans it is a passing chapter,'' he added, ''but for us, we have to live with this tragedy. Every Vietnamese family practically without exception has been touched by this war, families divided, lost or destroyed.''  He no longer dreams of a democratic and free Vietnam as he did as a young boy growing up in a mandarin family of scholars near Hanoi. His history teacher was Vo Nguyen Giap, who as General Giap would go on to lead the North Vietnamese Army against both France and the United States.  ''I was educated in the French way, and we learned about the Napoleonic wars and the revolution of 1789,'' Mr. Diem recalled. ''We went through a lot of books about fighting for the freedom of the people, and all of us got enthused by a kind of self-given mission to liberate the people.''  An estimated 800,000 Vietnamese now make their home in this country, with 20,000 or more living in the Washington area, said Mr. Diem, who is president of the executive board of Vietnamese in America, an umbrella group of Vietnamese organizations from all over the country working to encourage participation in the political process.  The group will hold its third annual convention in August on the West Coast. Mr. Diem is helping make plans for that while also spending a good bit of his time traveling and speaking to Vietnamese community groups.  Eye on the Mainstream  ''When the Vietnamese first came they were not very well organized,'' he said. ''But they are beginning, especially the younger people, to become part of the mainstream in this country. Every ethnic community has its lobby group, and as more and more Vietnamese gain their citizenship we expect to be a political force.''  Upon occasion Mr. Diem visits the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the walled monument on the Mall inscribed with the names of Americans killed or missing in the war.  ''It is a very strange feeling,'' he said, ''I don't know how to describe it. But often in looking at those Amerian names I think of the thousands and thousands of Vietnamese - soldiers and civilians - whose names are not listed anywhere.''  He paused then added: ''Perhaps it is feelings like that, that pushed me to write the book. It is a voice from Vietnam, and I hope it will be heard.''

"   , Thailand, Oct. 26   A hundred leaders of Vietnam's literary and artistic establishment have apparently told the country's new Communist Party leader in blunt terms what they think is wrong with state-supported cultural endeavors.  In reply, the party leader, Nguyen Van Linh, expressed frank astonishment at some of their complaints and made some startling revelations of his own, according to a partial transcript of the lively give-and-take broadcast by Hanoi's official radio.  Mr. Linh, who took office last December after what appears to have been a power struggle with the last of Ho Chi Minh's generation of leaders, said that he, too, had to remain on guard against party hard-liners who demand rigid orthodoxy in all fields.  Mr. Linh, saying he had been ''itching unbearably to write,'' acknowledged that he was the author of a new newspaper column, ''Things That Must Be Done Immediately,'' which has been the talk of Vietnam.  He then added: ''Many people have welcomed and responded favorably to it, but there are also people who wondered why I was blackening the regime, and thought that this might be the way to start a cultural revolution.'' The reference was to the period of radicalism that gripped China from 1966 to 1976.  Meeting Lasted Two Days  The two-day meeting, which Hanoi's domestic radio network said took place on Oct. 6 and 7, brought together writers, actors, film makers, musicians, sculptors, architects and other cultural leaders, according to a translation from Vietnamese made by the British Boradcasting Corporation's monitoring service.  The party's General Secretary told those attending not to be afraid to be muckrakers. At one point he was reported to have blurted out during an artist's speech, ''God helps them who help themselves!''  Mr. Linh - who was dropped from the Politburo from 1982 to 1985, apparently for advocating a more open economy - also said he understood the artists' fears of ''prohibitions and persecution.''  ''What you dread most,'' he said, ''is something hovering somewhere in the air that you fear more than censorship.''  Reporters visiting Vietnam in August were told by artists that they were seeking a meeting with Mr. Linh. Publishers, writers and dramatists said that the arts were reviving, but that many creative people were unsure how far they could go in pushing out political or oganizational bounds.  Artists Fault 'Despotic' Control  At the seminar, according to the official summary broadcast on Oct. 13, the cultural leaders criticized ''undemocratic, despotic and overbearing'' party control.  They attacked the system in which only official, state-subsidized artists are recognized. According to the radio, Mr. Linh expressed surprise that subsidies continued in this field when they had been abandoned in others.  ''You have demanded,'' Mr. Linh recalled in closing remarks, ''that in your domain work should not be imposed as a train is placed on the tracks.''  His remarks follow reports from international human rights organizations that seven writers arrested under the previous leadership may be about to go on trial. The cases have not been discussed in the official press, and there is no indication the subject was raised at the two-day meeting.  'Renovation' Is His Aim  As in other public speeches, Mr. Linh reminded his audience that ''renovation'' of the Communist system, not political change, was the aim of his campaign to open society. He referred several times to ''socialist realism,'' usually interpreted as the correct artistic style for a Communist society.  But Mr. Linh, who was Hanoi's link to the South during and after the Vietnam War, also said his own experiences in dealing with the ''old regime'' had taught him some lessons.  ''In the old days,'' he said, ''we used to espouse the simplistic concept that if one talked about socialist society, one had only good things to say.''  ''I have come to realize it is quite difficult to be so sure about things,'' he concluded.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",October 26 1987 ,1
"   , Laos, Nov. 20   The United States and Laos announced today that Washington would begin considering the ''humanitarian problems'' of this isolated country as Laotians step up the search for Americans missing since the Vietnam War.  The agreement is similar to one concluded this past summer between the United States and Vietnam, under which American experts on the missing have already visited Hanoi for consultation.  At the same time, the United States is about to deliver a shipment of rice to Laos, where this year's crop, now being harvested, has been severely affected by drought.  The announcement today followed the first formal Laotian-American technical meeting on the search for missing Americans, held here Nov. 11-13.  It also follows a visit to Vientiane last week by David Lambertson, Deputy Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, and a trip to Washington in October by the Laotian Deputy Foreign Minister, Soubanh Srithirath. #555 Unaccounted For in Laos Fourteen years after the United States withdrew from Indochina, 555 Americans are still unaccounted for in Laos. Most of them were shot down in bombing raids on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, along which the North Vietnamese resupplied Communist armies in the South through Laotian territory.  The United States also bombed the Plain of Jars, where Lao Communist forces were numerous.  In addition to the missing in Laos, 1,757 Americans are unaccounted for in Vietnam and 91 in Cambodia.  Laotians say they are reluctant to make the search for missing Americans a national priority when so many of their own people were killed by American bombing from 1964 to 1973. Farmers in Laotian villages are still dying and being maimed by ordnance exploding in fields.  But pressures in the United States from organizations representing the families of the missing in action and unaccounted-for prisoners of war have forced the Communist Pathet Lao Government, which seized power in 1975, to deal with the issue as a prerequisite to better relations with Washington.  Private Searches Condemned  Both Laos and the Reagan Administration have condemned private American efforts to mount searches in Laos. American opposition to these illegal forays into this country was repeated today in a joint statement, which said such ''irresponsible'' acts were impeding government-to-government cooperation.  The United States maintains diplomatic relations with Laos at the charge d'affaires level. The small American mission in Vientiane, led by Harriet W. Isom, is the only American embassy in the three Indochinese Communist countries of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  But there is no United States aid program in Laos, one of the world's poorest nations. Until recently, aid been blocked by Congress, and no funds have been authorized in a tight foreign aid budget.  Today, a joint press release from the Government of Laos and the United States Embassy said the Laotians were considering excavating by themselves a crash site in Savannakhet Province. Two previous excavations were conducted in cooperation with American teams from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii.  Trying to Resolve 3 Cases  In today's statement, the Laotians also said they were trying to resolve three cases where there are discrepancies about missing Americans. The statement gave no details, and Lao officials declined to be interviewed.  In return, the United States said it would respond ''within the limits of its capabilities'' to the humanitarian concerns of Laos.  As an example, the statement said an American non-governmental organization was considering erecting a prefabricated clinic in the area where Laos will conduct its excavation of the site of an American plane crash. The clinic would be stocked with medicines at American expense.  The statement did not specify the organization involved. The Mennonite Central Committee and the American Friends Service Committee have development programs in Laos, but those organizations said tonight that they were not the agency planning the clinic.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Dec. 3   A Vietnamese tribunal sentenced 17 people to prison today on charges of trying to stage a guerrilla invasion with American and Thai backing.  The three-day trial, conducted with maximum publicity on the stage of the municipal theater here, turned into an unexpected, sustained attack on the United States and Thailand at a time when Hanoi is trying to improve relations with both nations.  Uncharacteristically, China - usually portrayed here as the third partner in an anti-Vietnamese clique - was not mentioned as a supporter of the rebel organization, identified by the Vietnamese as the Armed Forces of Resistance. The group was said to have infiltrated Laos from Thailand in July, planning to enter Vietnam to commit sabotage and foment an uprising.  The leader of the guerrillas was reported to be a former South Vietnamese admiral, Hoang Co Minh, who became an American citizen a few years ago. Hanoi says Mr. Minh was killed in Laos in August with more than 100 other members of the group.  Picture of a U.S. General  ''Obviously, the U.S. imperialists are the mastermind, the inciter and supporter of Hoang Co Minh and his followers,'' the 16-page indictment said. The only evidence offered was a picture of Mr. Minh meeting an American general, identified as Paul Weigand, in Tokyo, possibly in 1982. [In Washington, officials of the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps said they could find no record of a Gen. Paul Weigand.] At the trial today, the presiding judge, Tran Tuan Sy, called the Thais ''the implementing agents of the American reactionaries.'' The indictment and court testimony held that Thailand had armed, trained and recruited resistance fighters from refugee camps where Vietnamese exiles were ''starved and beaten.''  Reporters here for the trial could not recall such charges of abuse from Vietnamese refugees, who are visited regularly in Thai camps.  The United States and Vietnam do not have diplomatic relations. No American officials are reachable from here for comment.  Dinh Van Be, charged with being one of the commanders, received a term of life imprisonment. Sixteen other defendants were given terms ranging from 3 to 19 years, and another defendant was put on probation.  All the defendants had pleaded guilty after extensive confessions.  Judge Sy demanded the deportation from the United States of what he called the remaining rebel ringleader, identified as Nguyen Kim. He also said the Thai and American Governments should dissolve such resistance groups now or ''bear the responsibility for the destabilization of Southeast Asia.''  New York Group Mentioned  Among the groups mentioned was a New York City committee reported to have been set up in 1984 and based in the Murry Bergtraum High School at 411 Pearl Street near Chinatown. Other groups were reported to be found in California. Ethnic Chinese defendants in this trial have been so identified in the indictments.  The trial proceedings were broadcast live through loudspeakers in the street outside the municipal theater, where a crowd gathered this afternoon for the sentencing.  An exhibition of evidence was mounted in the galleries around the main auditorium. In one exhibit, an organizational chart of the resistance army had an American flag at its apex. The indictment said American intelligence agents worked with the group.  Those Vietnamese who will talk about this trial and foreign diplomats in the region who have been following events since the attempted invasion of central Vietnam say Hanoi may intend to send a variety of messages.  Message to Young Dissenters  Internally, the proceedings and the sentences meted out to the young men, most in their 20's, tells the country's restive youth that this kind of dissent will be dealt with harshly. The sentences also make clear that in an era of some economic liberalization under a new party leadership, political opposition will not be tolerated.  The Government may have also wanted to deter Vietnamese from fleeing to Thailand by repeatedly describing refugee camps there as places of terror and hard labor. More boat people are fleeing Vietnam this year than at any time since the early 1980's.  Some diplomats suggest that in the point-counterpoint politics of Vietnam these treason cases, which reached trial unusually quickly, may show the determination of the Interior Ministry or other security organizations not to appear soft toward the West or Vietnam's non-Communist neighbors.  Foreign Ministry officials have been playing down the American angle in discussions with reporters this week.  Finally, the trial coincides, many diplomats think deliberately, with a much-publicized Vietnamese troop withdrawal from Cambodia and the opening of talks between the Hanoi-backed Phnom Penh Government and the Cambodian resistance movement under Prince Norodom Sihanouk.  In the trial, prosecutors referred again and again to the case as a demonstration of the need for ''Vietnam-Laos-Kampuchean solidarity.'' Two defendants were Cambodians.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   In April 1975, when the Republic of South Vietnam was on the edge of collapse, Nguyen Huu Co, a retired general and former Defense Minister, took stock of his options.  ''I thought first of leaving,'' he recalled. ''I had many American friends to help me. But the situation changed too fast.''  ''I failed to get out by plane because I had no priority,'' he went on. ''I went to Vung Tao and tried to leave by ship, but it was too risky. I had 11 children with me, and I couldn't accept the risk.''  Less than two months later, with Hanoi's army in control of this southern capital, Mr. Co was told to report for ''re-education.''  'Money and Clothes for Month'  ''They were very clever,'' he said. ''The announcement in the press and on television said that all people going to camp should bring enough money and clothes for one month.''  He was to remain in prison camps for more than 12 years. This September, at 62 years of age, he was released, the highest-ranking member of the former Government to be freed to date, officials say.  Diplomats and other foreigners in the country with contacts among Vietnamese officals believe that the release of Mr. Co and other generals shows some lessening in Hanoi's fears of former South Vietnamese military officers. Vietnamese acknowledge there was concern in the late 1970's that there would be a strong resistance in the South.  Some diplomats say that the highly publicized recent trial of guerrillas charged with trying to infiltrate the country through Laos under the leadership of a former South Vietnamese admiral might be a warning to those now being freed.  Describes His Experiences  Mr. Co, who met reporters at his home in the presence of a Government interpreter, although he speaks both English and French fluently, was relaxed as he described his experiences.  His account, if not complete, nevertheless provides information on conditions of important political prisoners serving long terms. It also documents the many shifts in prison procedures over the years that some diplomats in Hanoi think may have been at least in part related to political fluctuations.  In Mr. Co's experience, prisoners shifted from one ministry's control to another and moved from camp to camp more half a dozen times. Thousands of Vietnamese remain in these political prisons more than a decade after the Communist takeover.  An Exile in Hong Kong  Mr. Co, who was trained as a soldier by the French and Americans, was active in politics in the early 1960's, when he joined in overthrowing Ngo Dinh Diem, who, he said, ''made so many mistakes.'' Among these, he said, were promoting Roman Catholics from central Vietnam at the expense of southern Buddhists, and rewarding military men for loyalty, not merit.  By 1967, Mr. Co, then a Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister, had fallen out with Marshal Nguyen Cao Ky, whom he considered ''immature.'' He was sent into exile in Hong Kong for three years.  When President Nguyen Van Thieu allowed him to return in 1970, Mr. Co steered away from politics and became a commercial banker and later a businessman.  When he was arrested in June 1975, however, he was included in a group of 32 generals, and was treated as a military man in prison.  Sudden Move to the North  Mr. Co was first held at Quang Trung, about nine miles north of Ho Chi Minh City, as Saigon was soon renamed. Conditions were good, he said. Prisoners could read and watch television. There were political lectures.  In June 1976, he was suddenly moved at night by air to Yen Bay, 120 miles north of Hanoi. Handcuffed, Mr. Co calculated his new position by counting the hours of flying time -four - and by noting that the sun was rising to his right.  In 1978, he and other generals were moved to Ha Tay, in the Red River delta east of Hanoi, to an Interior Ministry camp. Hard labor ceased. Instead, Mr. Co said, they were asked to write everything they knew about the South's military strategies and the functioning of its Government.  Education and Labor  In 1979, Mr. Co says he was moved alone twice - to Nam Ha and Thanh Lam - and experienced a period of combined political education and manual labor. Military and civilian political prisoners were mixed.  By 1981, he had been returned to Ha Tay and the other former generals. His last move, in 1983 was back to Nam Ha, until his release.  ''The last four years were not so hard,'' he said. ''I read books sent by my family. I wrote them letters, but they took a long time - sometimes three months - to reach them.''  A Christian, he also prayed ''inside myself,'' he said, and thought.  Wife Began to Work  ''What I thought about most was the condition of life, and how I could take care of my family.'' His wife, Nguyen Thi Tin, who had never worked, had begun to knit for factories. ''It was different, but I got used to it,'' she said. ''My spirits were high.''  Mr. Co said he also thought about Communism and democracy.  ''In both systems there are some things good and some things bad,'' he said. ''We have to teach each other to take advantage of the good points and eliminate the bad.''  Mr. Co, who attends a Baptist church three or four times a week now, is trying to make contact with friends and relatives abroad who could advance him money to start a business. His daughter Lau Nguyen Ward in Alhambra, Calif., has already provided some assistance.  Ultimately, the Co family will have to decide whether to apply to emigrate under the Orderly Departure Program. Mr. Co says he cannot think of going unless all his family, now including 15 grandchildren and a daughter of 21 suffering from Down's Syndrome, can come. He has lost too many years of family life to want to strike out on his own.  ''We pray to God to lead me,'' he said. ''If he wants me to go out, he will arrange everything for me and my family. If things are difficult, that means God blocks our way.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo of Nguyen Huu Co and his wife, Nguyen Thi Tin (NYT/Fred R.

"    The trial of a group of anti-Communist guerrillas in Vietnam this month has provided an unexpected windfall of publicity for the fighters' organizers in the United States, leaders of Vietnamese refugees in this country say.  ''The Communists wanted to scare people at home into not joining the resistance, but they actually created a psychological victory for these people among Vietnamese in America,'' said Yen Do, editor of a Vietnamese language newspaper in Orange County, Calif.  Mr. Yen said that until the trial, in which 17 people were sentenced to prison for trying to infiltrate Vietnam through Laos, the anti-Hanoi movement among refugees in the United States had lost credibility because of lack of evidence of any effective military activity against the regime.  The main rebel group in the United States, the National United Front for the Liberation of Vietnam, had also suffered over the last two years from factionalism and charges of corruption among its leaders, according to Mr. Yen and other Vietnamese.  Fate of Leader Questioned  But the public trial in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, has also raised questions about the fate of the front's chairman, Hoang Co Minh, a former admiral in the South Vietnamese Navy who became a house painter in Washington after escaping to the United States in 1975. Hanoi says Mr. Minh was killed in Laos in August as he tried to infiltrate from Thailand into Vietnam with 200 fighters.  But a spokesman for the front, Nguyen Dong Son, denied that Mr. Minh is dead. ''Admiral Hoang Co Minh is safe,'' Mr. Son said by telephone from the organization's headquarters in San Jose, Calif. ''This is just a disinformation scheme by the Communists.''  Asked why Mr. Minh had not reappeared to rebut the statements about his death, Mr. Son said: ''Do you think it is easy for him to sneak out of Vietnam? He is leading the struggle.''  But Mr. Yen and other Vietnamese say the more time that passes without an appearance by Mr. Minh the greater the doubts that he is alive.  Nevertheless, Bui Diem, a former South Vietnamese Ambassador to the United States who now lives in Washington, said the trial and all the speculation about Mr. Minh ''gives the front enormous publicity, way beyond what they could get by themselves.''  'Created a Lot of Interest'  He added that ''it has created a lot of interest in the Vietnamese community,'' now estimated to number more than half a million in the United States.  The trial has also raised sensitive questions for the Reagan Administration, since Mr. Minh became an American citizen and some of the other guerrillas killed or captured with him are reported to have American citizenship.  An American official said the State Department had ''made appropriate inquiries'' of the Vietnamese authorities to determine if any of those put on trial were Americans but so far had not received any evidence of that.  At the trial, the indictment charged that ''obviously, the U.S. imperialists are the mastermind, the inciter and supporter of Hoang Co Minh and his followers.'' The presiding judge also demanded the deportation from the United States of the man he called the remaining rebel ringleader, Nguyen Kim, and said the American Government should dissolve such anti-Hanoi groups or ''bear the responsibility for the destabilization of Southeast Asia.''  Mr. Kim, an official of the front, did not return phone calls to his office in San Jose.  Improved Ties Sought  The Vietnamese criticism of the United States comes as Washington and Hanoi have been moving gingerly to improve relations. Last summer the two nations concluded an agreement providing for American experts to visit Vietnam to help search for Americans missing since the Vietnam War.  An American official knowledgeable about Vietnam said the Government was not involved in any way in helping Mr. Minh. ''We've really got clean hands on this,'' he said.  He added that intelligence reports showed that the fighting in August in Laos in which Mr. Minh was supposedly killed ''was not a pure rout as Hanoi said.'' Instead, the official said, there were more than 20 sharp engagements, which indicated a surprising level of training and equipment on the part of the rebels. The front also had more troops than the 200 mentioned by Hanoi, but fewer than the 10,000 the front has claimed, the official said.  Front's Leaders Split  The front was organized in 1982 and established a clandestine radio transmitter that could be heard in Ho Chi Minh City, according to recent Vietnamese refugees. But two years ago a number of the front's leaders split with Mr. Minh over charges that he and his brother had embezzled funds raised from refugees so they could finance a chain of Vietnamese restaurants.  The front became embroiled in further controversy because Mr. Son, its spokesman and some believe its key leader now, is a relative of the new General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Nguyen Van Linh. Mr. Son, a former economic official in the Saigon Government, stayed on in Vietnam after the Communist victory in 1975 and was not jailed, as most officials and officers were. He was later able to leave Vietnam under the official Orderly Departure Program.  Mr. Son's easy fate after 1975 has raised accusations that he was protected by Mr. Linh, a serious charge among Vietnamese refugees, who are staunch anti-Communists. But Mr. Son denies it, saying his family lost touch with Mr. Linh in 1930.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 20 1987 ,0

Foreign investment has not poured in, only partly because of a delay in introducing a long-promised investment code.  Foreigners who have looked at drafts of the legislation say it will be only a beginning. Yet Vietnamese officials talk about huge resort developments, oil refineries and food-processing factories in a country without adequate communication and public services.  Speaking with reporters recently about his expectations of a contract with Club Med or other international resort developers, the a tourism official mentioned casually that the foreigners might be asked to build the necessary roads to the beaches first.

"   , Thailand, Dec. 28   Vietnam has announced a sweeping domestic economic policy that in effect abandons centralized planning in favor of managerial decision-making at the factory level in state enterprises.  Vietnamese press and radio reports say the policy also introduces worker incentives, quality control, shareholding, an expanded banking industry and wage scales linked to productivity. It is to take effect Jan. 1.  While some of these concepts have been discussed and occasionally allowed to operate over the last few years, Vietnamese officials and diplomats say that the decision is the most comprehensive economic policy change since the unification of Vietnam in 1975.  ''After nearly a decade of exploration of the realities, now a new structure of management has been formed,'' the Vietnamese Communist Party daily newspaper, Nhan Dan, said in an editorial Dec. 16. The policy pronouncement, read in installments on the Government's domestic radio service, has since been collated and translated for the British Broadcasting Corporation's monitoring service. No date was given for the decision.  Leader's Grip Seems Tighter  The publication of an economic plan comprehensive enough to include everything from how to handle capital depreciation to the need for day-care centers in factories appears to indicate the strengthening of the hand of Vietnam's party leader, Nguyen Van Linh, who has been in office a year.  Mr. Linh, along with Vo Van Kiet, the Government's chief economic planner and others in the new hierarchy, have been advocating the ''renovation'' of Vietnam's economy through the use of unorthodox methods. But there have been few positive results because, diplomats suggest, the country is devoid of economic expertise and still subject to intervention, if not sabotage, by hard-line Marxists.  Earlier this month, when the party's Central Committee met, it heard gloomy reports of acute problems on economic, social and security fronts. Vietnam, cut off from Western assistance by its occupation of neighboring Cambodia and entirely reliant on the Soviet bloc for aid, is among the world's poorest nations.  Today, Mr. Kiet, who is also a Deputy Prime Minister, told the National Assembly that Vietnam was losing the battle to feed its growing population. He said the food available to each person had dropped by 8 percent since 1985, when low consumption levels of needed nutrients had already begun to cause widespread malnutrition.  The changes in economic policy reflect similar rethinking in the Soviet Union, but Vietnamese officials are defensive when asked if Moscow had demanded an end to the inefficiencies and corruption that have ''squandered'' Soviet aid, by Hanoi's admission.  Vietnamese say the parallel policy changes are coincidental, and point to experiments in free-market economics in what was formerly South Vietnam in the early 1980's, shortly after its conquest by the North. Those experiments - really extensions of South Vietnam's traditional ways of doing business - were suppressed by hard-liners in Hanoi led by the party leader, Le Duan, and his successor, Truong Chinh. Mr. Linh was purged from the Politburo in 1982 for his support for ''southern'' methods.  Vietnamese see the move now toward decentralization, the end to subsidies and the beginning of cost accounting, bank financing and other free-market practices as the product of a confluence of thinking in Moscow and Hanoi.  The Talents of the People  Vietnam, its officials say, still has major problems of underdevelopment to overcome. But Vietnamese officials and diplomats say they are aware of the inherent abilities of the people, demonstrated by their economic success as exiles.  The party daily Dan referred to the need to ''liberate all the potential'' and to ''create energy'' among the Vietnamese. The new economic code, for example, will allow Vietnamese workers to go to international trade fairs for ''market research.''  It will also allow workers to submit ideas for improved production and employers to hire and dismiss workers free of political pressures.

"   , Thailand, April 18   The people of Vietnam will vote Sunday in the first national elections to offer a genuine choice of candidates, according to official newspaper and television reports.  Voters will choose 496 deputies to the National Assembly, the third to be elected since the country was unified under Communist rule in 1975. They will also vote for local councils.  Under new election procedures similar to those being introduced in the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, each constituency must have more candidates on the ballot than the seats to be filled.  Vietnam is a single-party state - the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan called it ''a tool of the socialist collective mastery system'' and a ''proletarian dictatorship'' - and all candidates are required to accept the Communist ideology.  ''The election must be carried out in a truly democratic manner,'' the newspaper said. ''Voters should not be driven into a situation where they merely have to cast their votes for a preselected name list.''  Correction of Abuses Ordered  Local party organizations have been bombarded with directives about conducting self-criticism, correcting political abuses, eliminating high-handed attitudes and listening to the sentiments of local people.  Exemplary provinces have been praised in the official press - at least one was reported to have introduced secret balloting in candidate selection - while those with poor performance have been castigated.  On March 23, according to a domestic radio broadcast monitored and translated by the BBC, a team of Hanoi assemblymen ''in a serious mood'' reviewed their performance and found flaws. The team ''was slow in solving complaints and denunciations from constituents'' and contributed little ''to the building of various social-economic projects in the capital,'' the radio said.  In the election Sunday, the Hanoi candidate list will be led by Nguyen Van Linh, who became General Secretary of the Communist Party in December.  Assembly Will Meet in June  Constituencies throughout the country have been directed to send into retirement members who are too old or ill to function effectively and to look for replacements who ''set good examples in their life style.''  The new assembly will not meet until June. Its first session is expected to coincide with the completion of changes at the top levels of the Government, according to Vietnamese officials and Hanoi-based diplomats.

"   , Thailand, April 19   Vietnam reported a heavy turnout today in general elections intended to ease out the Communist Party's old guard and bring in a new and more efficient government.  The Hanoi radio said more than half the voters cast their ballots before noon.  It was the third election held since reunification in 1975 and the country's most open to date.  Pham Van Dong, who has been chairman of the Council of Ministers since 1955, confirmed he would be stepping down when the new Assembly meets in June, according to a broadcast monitored here.  ''I've been in this post too long,'' Mr. Dong, 81 years old, told journalists after casting his vote in Hanoi. ''The National Assembly will find a worthy person to hold this post.''  Voters were offered 829 candidates for 496 seats and were urged to pick a more dynamic legislature to carry out the new policies set out by the ruling Communist Party.  Truong Chinh, 80, the State Council chairman and the only other living link to the group around Ho Chi Minh that founded the party in 1930, was also expected to be replaced by the Assembly in June.  Nguyen Van Linh, who replaced Mr. Chinh as party chief in December, stressed that his policy of economic ''renovation'' meant that deputies must be more accountable to the electorate.  ''Deputies must listen to the opinions of the people,'' Mr. Linh, 72, said after opening a polling station in the capital.  Twelve years after defeating the United States-backed Saigon Government, Vietnam still suffers shortages of food and consumer goods; inflation has been as high as 700 percent, and there has been widespread corruption and failure to meet production targets.  Under Mr. Linh's leadership, the party announced major changes last week, using Western-style support for private business to revive the economy.

"      The Reagan Administration has proposed to Vietnam that Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visit Hanoi as a Presidential representative to discuss the fate of missing servicemen.  But State Department officials said the visit, which was proposed last week, would not take place unless the two nations could agree on how to move forward discussions on the issue.  ''We're not sending a Presidential envoy unless a policy-level, advance delegation goes to Hanoi first,'' Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said today.  There has been no response from the Vietnamese to the proposal, which was also presented privately last month by H. Ross Perot, the Texas industrialist who worked for the White House last year on issues relating to prisoners of war and those missing in action.  Mr. Perot's mission, which Mr. Redman said was undertaken ''at his own initiative,'' was reported today by The Washington Post.  In an interview today, Mr. Perot said the Vietnamese had been pleased by the idea of talks with General Vessey. He denounced Mr. Redman's statements, saying it was counterproductive to set conditions for the visit.  Mr. Perot said: ''They feel, and I am quoting them, that we send people over who are minor officials, who only make demands, who are rude and arrogant. A Presidential negotiator is the right answer, and Vessey is the right man.''  Mr. Redman said today that ''our difficulties in moving ahead'' on the issue are primarily due to Vietnam's refusal ''to engage in any technical or policy level talks, in order to reconfirm our understanding of the nature of the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue.''

"   , Thailand, May 1   As the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations prepare for new rounds of talks with Vietnam on missing Americans and the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, the Japanese are being criticized in this region for steadily expanding Hanoi trade.  Asean has sought to isolate Vietnam economically so long as 140,000 Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia.  Within the last week, Vietnam reported it had sold its first crude oil exports to two Japanese firms, Nissho Iwai and C. Itoh & Company. At almost the same time a consortium of 90 Japanese companies announced it was building a trade center in Hanoi.  Japanese businesses, sometimes acting with the help of the Japanese Communist Party, have been active in Hanoi for several years. Western diplomats in Hanoi say the businesses are positioning themselves to be Vietnam's dominant non-Communist trading partner when an unofficial but effective aid and trade embargo is lifted.  Asean leaders say Japan's trade links undercut efforts to use the promise of improved economic ties as a way of getting Vietnam to compromise on its eight-year Cambodia occupation. In a formal protest in late April, envoys of the six Asean countries - Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines - asked the Japanese Government to dissuade Nissho Iwai from giving unofficial economic assistance to Vietnam until Hanoi's forces are withdrawn from Cambodia. Japan has provided no official economic aid to Hanoi since Vietnamese troops toppled the Communist Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 and installed another Communist Government that has been more cooperative.  Asean's protests over trade come as Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, who speaks for the Association on the Cambodia question, is about to visit both Washington and Hanoi to try to reopen stalled discussions with the Vietnamese.  Also in May, Thailand's Foreign Minister, Siddhi Savetsila, will be going to Moscow to raise again the issue of Cambodia with his Soviet counterpart. The Soviet Union is Vietnam's main military and economic backer, and Asean wants Moscow's help in getting Vietnam to withdraw its troops.  These trips follow a recent announcement in Washington that the Reagan Administration is prepared to send the former chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff, Gen. John W. Vessey, Jr., to Hanoi as a special envoy to hasten the resolution of the cases of more than 2,000 missing Americans.  Hanoi-based diplomats say that Vietnam's recent actions may reflect political disagreement on how to deal with the United States.  There are no trade or diplomatic links between Washington and Hanoi, although economists say over $20 million in American goods reaches Vietnam through third countries each year.  Asean countries, led by Singapore, trade with Vietnam and Cambodia, although the amount of legal income is small. Smugglers supply the markets of Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, and to a lesser extent Vietnamese cities, where goods from relatives abroad often dominate some shops.  Hanoi, facing severe economic problames, is now promising to make more of this private trade legal. Thai businesses have already expressed an interest in broadening commercial ties, arguing that their activities should not be linked to the Thai Government's demands that the 140,000 Vietnamese troops leave Cambodia first.  All regional nations, most oil producers, have been watching the development of Hanoi's oil industry with interest. There are assumed to be substantial reserves off the coast of southern Vietnam in Vung Tau, but the Vietnamese, working with the Soviet Union, are hampered in exploration and drilling by a lack of equipment.  Some economists believe significant quantities of oil are being lost or wasted. There are no pipelines, refineries or storage facilities in Vietnam.  His report said that four Japanese companies - Nippon Kokan, Nippon Steel, Kawasaki Steel and Sumimoto Metal Industries - are thought to be negotiating with Vietsovpetro, a state oil company, for pipeline construction contracts.

"      Malnutrition in Vietnam has become serious and widespread, and beriberi, a diet-related nervous disorder, is occurring in the army in epidemic proportions, according to the head of a military medical institute in Hanoi.  Troops are also afflicted by malaria, encephalitis, intestinal problems, fungal skin diseases and other ailments whose treatment is hampered by lack of medical supplies and proper sanitation, the institute director, Le The Trung, wrote in the Vietnamese Communist Party's daily newspaper, Nhan Dan.  His 1,900-word article contains some of the most specific information available on the deteriorating state of health in Vietnam, one of the world's poorest nations.  The article follows a series of more general criticisms from the army about the effects of poor economic management in Vietnam. It also comes at a time when urgent calls for policy changes seem to be encountering sharp resistance from advocates of political orthodoxy.  Evidence of Malnutrition  International health and welfare organizations have been concerned for several years about mounting evidence of malnutrition in Vietnam, which lags well behind most Asian nations in development. Vietnam is also thought to have one of the world's highest birth rates, which further diminishes limited natural resources.  Exiles arriving in Thailand and other Southeast Asian nations by boat have begun to tell of starvation in Vietnam. Some diplomats in Hanoi, using international projections based on malnutrition data, say some Vietnamese might be dying of hunger. But there has been no verifiable evidence of this.  Doctors in Vietnam tell reporters that intestinal diseases are dangerously widespread, however, and this, coupled with inadequate intake of proteins or vitamins, puts children and the elderly at great risk. A hospital director in Ho Chi Minh City explained that in cities sanitation systems installed by the French more than half a century ago were often the cause of the problem, as broken pipes allowed contaminated water to flow into drinking supplies.  The article by Mr. Trung, published on April 6 and translated early this month by the British Broadcasting Corporation's foreign monitoring service, said that the military medical institute had studied more than 1,000 cases of beriberi, an illness of the nervous system that results from a deficiency of vitamin B-1, or thiamine.  Epidemic Forms of Diseases  Malnutrition-related diseases, Mr. Trung wrote, ''occur in some localities in apparently epidemic forms, such as beriberi and neuritis, followed by organic atrophy.'' In some cases, he said, ''they affected even the brain and heart.''  Beriberi has been common in Asian countries in which people subsist on a diet of polished white rice. It is characterized by inflammation of the nerves, heart problems and edema.  Mr. Trung also said that in some areas, ''types of persistent and virulent malaria'' have ranked as the most prevalent internal diseases.  ''Such internal diseases as diarrhea, dysentery, hemorrhagic fever, conjunctivitis, influenza and encephalitis are also noted,'' he said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 14 1987 ,1

"      Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and President Truong Chinh, the last founders of the Vietnamese Communist Party still in power in Hanoi, were removed today by a vote of the National Assembly.  Their departure ends more than half a century of unbroken party and government leadership by colleagues and contemporaries of Ho Chi Minh.  The two men replaced today had resigned their party Politburo seats in December, when Mr. Chinh was apparently also forced out as General Secretary of the Communist Party. Mr. Dong had said publicly he wanted to retire.  Mr. Dong, who is 81 years old, was replaced as Prime Minister by Pham Hung, formerly Interior Minister, and Mr. Chinh, 80, was succeeded as President by Vo Chi Cong, a Deputy Prime Minister and former Agriculture Minister. Both newly elected officials are in their mid-70's, and both had played major political roles in North Vietnam's war against South Vietnam in the 1960's and early 70's.   New Party Chief in Charge  The choices were the least surprising of several possibilities that have been discussed in the region since the Sixth Party Congress in December, when Nguyen Van Linh was named the new party leader, putting him in the country's most important job. Mr. Hung and Mr. Cong have ranked as No. 2 and 3 in the Politburo hierarchy since then.  Foreign Ministers of the non-Communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations, meeting here today with their counterparts from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the European Community, said they foresaw no new policies in Hanoi as a result of the leadership changes.  Before the final steps in a yearlong political reorganization in Vietnam were announced today, Secretary of State George P. Shultz told the annual conference of the Asean nations -Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines -that it was ''imperative to keep pressure on the Vietnamese to end their occupation'' of Cambodia.  Mr. Linh, 71, the first party leader not to have been part of Ho's inner circle, is considered an economic pragmatist who was apparently influenced by the prosperity of the south while serving as Hanoi's top official there during the war against South Vietnamese and American forces.  The election of Mr. Hung as Prime Minister suggests that Mr. Linh could be meeting resistance from hardliners. Mr. Hung, a security expert who took command of the Central Office for South Vietnam in 1967, stayed on after Hanoi's conquest of Saigon in 1975, in a period when the policy of the unified nation was to crush the south.

"   , Thailand, July 8   Hanoi's official press has begun to lend credence to recent assertions by young boat people that alienation and protest among Vietnam's youth are on the rise.  Young Vietnamese are not likely to attempt public demonstrations, as their counterparts in South Korea or China have been doing recently. In the decade after the unification of the nation under Hanoi's rule, Vietnam has been one of Asia's most repressive countries. For many, the only avenue of protest is escape.  But recently there have been reports, for example, that a power plant was sabotaged by its young employees. Also there have been reports of a youth magazine's campaign to free a contributor who was arrested after he called living conditions for rural teachers ''deplorable.''  On Tuesday, the Vietnamese press agency reported that thousands of young criminals who had fallen under the influence of ''peer pressure'' or adult lawbreakers were being rehabilitated in schools for juvenile delinquents. The report said 8,000 youths had already been sent from these vocational schools to jobs in agriculture or construction industries.  Internal Criticism Urged  Under a pragmatic new Communist Party leader, Nguyen Van Linh, the Vietnamese are being urged to expose faults and shortcomings - an echo of the Soviet campaign for ''openness.''  Mr. Linh is assumed to be the author of a column titled ''Things to Be Done Immediately'' and signed ''N. V. L.'' that appears in the main Communist Party newspaper, Nhan Dan. The column advocates a vigorous restructuring of the economy, within the confines of Marxism-Leninism, and calls for full disclosure of failures.  There is resistance to this policy, Vietnam publications and radio broadcasts say, just as in the Soviet Union.  Nevertheless, frank airings of grievances and revelations of corruption have become daily fare. In the process, concerns about what official press organizations call ''juvenile delinquency'' or ''negative phenomenon among youth'' are beginning to appear more often - or be reported more fully.  According to exiles - many of them young people who say they are disillusioned with the country's bleak economic prospects despite more than a year of promises of reform - the young people engage mostly in passive resistance to directives. There is draft evasion and occasional sabotage.  Hanoi's domestic radio network reported in detail on one case of willful destruction on June 29.  Widespread Theft at Plant  The report, translated by the British Broadcasting Corporation's monitoring service, said that Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union at the Pha Lai power plant in Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon, had looked at recent sabotage and made the following discovery:  ''Thefts of materials, equipment and coal; the removal of insulating tubes, and especially the stealing of accesories to starters on electrical equipment have occurred in the plant. More dangerously, thieves have replaced stolen electrical accessories with fake ones. Nearly all the 22 arrested persons are Youth Union members and workers in the plant.''  Young people fleeing Vietnam by boat say they fear forced farm labor in what are called new economic zones because of the harsh conditions. Young men also say they do not want to fight in Cambodia or on the Chinese border, both high-casualty areas where, they say, ''troublemakers'' are sent.  On June 28, Hanoi's radio service reported that ''assault youth security teams'' have been formed along Vietnam's northern border. The broadcast said that about 1,250 young people ''have volunteered to join in carrying out patrol duty, setting up ambushes and setting up special action cells.''  These cells, the radio said, are designed ''to popularize state policies and the law.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 9 1987 ,1
"      Secretary of State George P. Shultz confirmed today that Vietnam had relented and agreed to American conditions for a meeting with a special envoy to discuss the issue of missing servicemen.  But Mr. Shultz, speaking at the annual meeting of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, also warned that there might not be much progress on the issue. He said it was good that Vietnam no longer insisted that discussions on missing servicemen be linked with the issue of normalizing relations.  ''We are pleased that the Vietnamese Government has accepted our proposal for a visit by a Presidential emissary on P.O.W. and M.I.A. and other humanitarian issues,'' he said. ''We are also pleased that Hanoi has confirmed that the two sides should not link these humanitarian issues with any outstanding political problem between our two countries.''  Earlier this month a Vietnamese official said Hanoi had sent American negotiators a letter dropping many previous conditions for talks.  Mr. Shultz warned, however, that Vietnam might still try to get economic aid in exchange for genuine discussion on the missing servicemen.  ''We intend to honor that agreement and expect Vietnam's leaders to do the same,'' he said of the understanding that normalization of relations will not be included in discussions. ''Nevertheless, in spite of these agreements, we must face the possibility that we will not be able to move the issue forward.''  Disturbed by Press Reports  He said he was disturbed by press reports that despite the agreement, Vietnam might try to raise the issue of reparations and economic aid under the heading of humanitarian cooperation.  ''Humanitarian reciprocity is one thing, but any attempt to trade information on our missing men for economic aid is another,'' he said. ''We cannot agree to this.''  An American negotiating team returned from Hanoi in May after failing to persuade Vietnam to accept the visit from the special presidential envoy, Gen. John A. Vessey Jr., retired, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  ''The Government of Vietnam has agreed to receive General Vessey to discuss the issue in Hanoi,'' Mr. Shultz said today. ''We are working out the final details with the Vietnamese now.''  No date has been set for the Vessey mission, officials said.  Foreign Minister Interviewed  His remark about press reports apparently refers to an interview with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, in The Washington Post this month from Hanoi. Mr. Thach said Vietnam intended to raise a wide variety of issues under the category of humanitarian matters, including property damage and personal injuries suffered during the Vietnam War.  ''If we can help the Americans on M.I.A.'s, then the Americans can help us heal our wounds of war,'' he said.  The United States has been seeking Vietnamese help in determining the fate of more than 2,500 American servicemen who were missing in action or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps.  American officials said Hanoi had been stalling on agreeing to the meeting in hopes that Washington would to allow the discussions to include the normalization of relations. The Vietnamese believe that normalization discussions would include the issue of reparations.  The Reagan Administration has been adamant that talks about the missing servicemen must precede any discussion of improving diplomatic relations.  Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, suggested this week that the Administration proceed quickly with normalizing relations with Hanoi.

"      President Reagan announced today that his special envoy, Gen. John A. Vessey, would travel to Hanoi next month in an attempt to revive negotiations over missing American servicemen.  The announcement indicated that Vietnam had ended an attempt to link the high-level talks to economic assistance and political concerns, including the war in Cambodia.  A senior White House official said General Vessey, a retired officer and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would seek the resumption of technical talks on identifying the remains of missing American servicemen or prisoners of war. Vietnam broke off such talks in October, when American officials asserted that Hanoi was stalling to gain concessions on other issues.  ''Both sides have agreed that these discussions on humanitarian issues should not be linked to any outstanding normalization of relations or the Cambodian qustions,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.  The visit, which was arranged in recent weeks, will take place Aug. 1-3.  American estimates placed the number of United States servicemen who are missing from the Vietnam War or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps at 2,500. In September, the Pentagon said intelligence files and other evidence indicated that some American prisoners of war were still alive in Southeast Asia and that ''a large volume of evidence'' points to the likelihood that they are being held by the Vietnamese Government.

"      The ghosts of Vietnam haunt Senator John McCain and Colleen C. Shine. And they are not alone.  ''There is no way, absolutely no way, that we'll ever close the chapter on that unhappy part of America's history, the Vietnam War, unless we have a full accounting for those who are still listed as missing in action,'' said Senator McCain, a leader in Congress on the issue. The Arizona Republican, a former Navy pilot who was shot down over Hanoi in 1967, spent nearly six years in a prisoner-of-war camp and knew ''a couple of guys'' still listed as missing.  For Colleen C. Shine, the issue of the missing is more wrenching. ''My father, Lieut. Col. Anthony C. Shine, was shot down on the border between North Vietnam and Laos on Dec. 2, 1972,'' she said quietly. ''I was eight years old then. I have a memory of him. He's still unaccounted for.''  The Vessey Mission  From this vantage point, Senator McCain and numerous Congressional colleagues, as well as Ms. Shine, the public affairs coordinator for the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, gaze with wary hope at one of the highest-level efforts by the Reagan Administration to discuss the issue of missing American servicemen in Southeast Asia.  From Saturday through Monday, a mission headed by Gen. John A. Vessey, and including senior Defense and State Department officials, will be in Hanoi to discuss the United States servicemen who are still listed as missing in action or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps.  Few issues have stirred more frustration and - to families involved -despair, and few have had a more tenacious hold on politicians.  Legislators as ideologically apart as Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts have called for a ''full accounting'' from Vietnam of the fate of the so-called ''M.I.A.'s.'' On Tuesday, the Senate and House endorsed overwhelmingly, and without objection, proposals that supported General Vessey's visit to Vietnam.  ''The issue has taken on a sort of mythic character,'' said one key Senate aide.  Underneath the resolutions and ringing words, though, are only unanswered questions.  ''There's much fuzziness about what the words 'full accounting' really mean,'' the aide acknowledged. He and others said privately that no member of Congress would ever deny the possibility that, more than 12 years after the war, Americans are being held in Vietnam. But few actually believe it, the aide said.  ''What happened on this issue were two things,'' the Senate aide explained. ''When Reagan was elected he took a strong profile in '81 that the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue was not resolved - a view that he expressed even as Governor of California. And you had the spate of Rambo movies which perpetuated the idea that there are living Americans held against their will there. Of course, the Vietnamese didn't help with their attitude involving the return of American remains.''  The Vietnamese have denied knowing of any remaining American prisoners, and they have denounced as fabrications refugee reports of caches of American remains that have not been returned to families.  ''We do have solid reason to believe that the Vietnamese have been less than forthcoming in the return of the remains of those serivcemen who died,'' said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the House panel on Asian and Pacific Affairs. ''Why? I suppose they may feel there's a certain amount of mileage in doling them out. It's a ghoulish business, very cynical, but we have good reason to believe they could be more forthcoming.''  Diplomats believe the M.I.A. issue is sometimes involved in internal Vietnamese politics.  Thanh Bham, an attache at the Vietnamese Mission to the United Nations, said his country had tried many things in the last 14 years to resolve the problem, including returning all military and civilian personnel taken prisoner in the war, repatriating others who had remained in Vietnam and ''devoting great efforts for seeking information'' about Americans still missing.  ''I think that all these facts demonstrates the efforts and the sympathy of Vietnam towards the American people and American concerns on this issue,'' he said, ''although Vietnam has hundreds of thousands of its own soldiers missing in action.''  According to Ms. Shine's group, Vietnam has returned the remains of 170 identified servicemen since 1974. Most of them, 94, have been returned during the Reagan Presidency.  Like other legislators, Mr. Solarz is doubtful about the possibility of Americans still held captive in Southeast Asia, but he refuses to rule it out. He said ''a substantial number of live sightings'' by refugees, some of whom passed polygraph tests, had led him to conclude that it was ''not inconceivable'' that American prisoners remain in Vietnam.  Senator McCain was more categorical. ''We have to assume that there are Americans still alive in Southeast Asia,'' he said. ''I have no hard evidence of that and I base it on two factors. The first is the reports of unresolved live sightings. The second are what some highly experienced and highly respected peeople have said about this.''  He cited the comment last October by Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe Jr., a former director of Defense Intelligence, who concluded after a five-month review of intelligence files that there was ''a large volume of evidence,'' mainly ''live sightings'' by Vietnamese refugees, that pointed to the likelihood that Americans are still imprisoned in Vietnam.  It is widely believed in Washington that some Americans willingly stayed behind in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City.  Complicating the issue, both politically and emotionally, is the position of the Vietnam veterans.  ''A lot of Vietnam veterans are fed up and don't want to hear about it,'' said Mike Leaveck, communications director of the Vietnam Veterans of America, which says it represents 30,000 former servicemen and women. ''There's a lot of craziness on this issue.''  He pointed out that after World War II, a total of 78,000 American servicemen were unaccounted for. After the Korean War, the figure was 8,000. The figure for Southeast Asia is now 2,413. ''The tragedy is that certain fringe groups have discredited this issue and have exploited the pain of many families,'' he said.  Senator McCain agrees: ''This entire issue has been exploited very badly by some people, including those trying to get funds for so-called Rambo efforts, people trying to inflame passions unnecessarily, charlatans, in some cases, who see this as a profit-making opportunity.''  On the other hand, Ms. Shine's group, known familiarly as the National League of M.I.A. and P.O.W. Families, maintains strong relations with Congress, the White House and the Vietnam veterans. Its executive director, Ann Mills Griffiths, whose brother is missing in Vietnam, routinely attends White House and State Department meetings on the issue and went along on General Vessey's mission to Hanoi this weekend.  Praise for Reagan  Ms. Shine said the organization has a membership of 3,500 families. She said that previous Administrations had responded with ''apathy and non-effort'' to the issue but that Mr. Reagan had brought it to the forefront. ''As Governor of California he wore a P.O.W.-M I.A. bracelet,'' she said. ''He has made this the highest national priority.''  Ms. Shine remarked that 20 years after the Vietnamese war against the French, non-French legionnaires who had been held prisoner were returned. What advantage would the Vietnamese have in keeping American prisoners, she asked.  ''I don't have the answers,'' she said. And then, after a moment, the young woman who last saw her father when she was 8, added: ''You have to believe in blind faith.''

"   , Vietnam, July 31   A special envoy of President Reagan and a new Vietnamese leadership are to open talks here Saturday on resolving the issue of Americans still missing in Vietnam 14 years after the withdrawal of United States forces.  Vietnamese officials are declining to comment publicly on what they hope to achieve in their talks with the special envoy, John W. Vessey Jr., the retired Army general and former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Hanoi put off receiving him until a sweeping leadership change was completed in June.  But Western European as well as East bloc diplomats in Hanoi say there has never been a more opportune moment for Hanoi and Washington to start anew on the process of building a relationship. The first step would be to make real progress on the issue of what happened to more than 2,400 missing Americans - 1,776 of them lost in Vietnam or off its shores, the others vanished in Laos or Cambodia.  A Special Shared Experience  The Vessey mission will also include Richard Childress, the National Security Council's director for Asian affairs; Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia; Gen. Robert Kingston, former director of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii; David F. Lambertson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, and several aides, according to the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry.  The sense of a special shared experience with America is very strong in Vietnam, foreigners in Hanoi say again and again. American visitors uniformly get a poignantly warm welcome.  A diplomat remarked this week that it was almost as if the war with the United States was the catharsis that allowed the Vietnamese to find their own self-image.  ''America is part of Vietnamese life,'' the diplomat said. The dollar is also the most important medium of exchange.  This diplomat and others say that the new leadership under Nguyen Van Linh, the Communist Party General Secretary chosen last December, must expand its links with the West if it is to head off even worse economic problems.  Mr. Linh's appointment was followed in June by the naming of a new Prime Minister, Pham Hung, who replaced Pham Van Dong. Vo Chi Cong became President at the same time, replacing Truong Chinh, the last party leader and head of state drawn from Ho Chi Minh's inner circle.  Vietnam is among the world's poorest nations. Its inflation rate is somewhere over 600 percent by most estimates. There is serious, widespread malnutrition and disease. In a risky political gamble, the new leaders are trying to tackle all these problems at the same time they begin a purge of corrupt party officials.  Vietnam receives large amounts of Soviet assistance, possibly $2 billion a year. This has sustained the army and provided a start on large-scale energy development, but has produced little or no visible improvement in day-to-day life.  Many Vietnamese, unhappy at their lot, have begun to display ''negative phenomena,'' the Government says. These include passive resistance to orders, draft-dodging and sabotage of an already weak economic structure.  Washington, leading an effective embargo, holds the key to Western aid, and the Reagan Administration has made the resolution of the missing Americans issue a condition for recognizing Hanoi.  Withdrawal of Vietnamese Troops  The United States, following the lead of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Thailand, Malasia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines - has also demanded the withdrawal of about 140,000 Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, more soldiers than Moscow has in Afghanistan.  Vietnamese officials and diplomats note in this context that Hanoi's leadership has just met this week for the first time in a year with the Asean spokesman on Cambodia, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja.  Diplomats and other foreigners in Hanoi and other Southeast Asian capitals say that over the last year, almost imperceptibly, the Cambodia war has become a bigger burden for the Vietnamese leadership, politically, economically and strategically.  The Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, who is now also a Deputy Prime Minister and will lead the Vietnamese delegation in talks with the Vessey mission, has been reviving his pleas for a greater American participation in un= tangling the problems of Indochina left behind by the war.  Hanoi is abuzz with rumors about whether or not the Americans and Vietnamese will agree to the opening of an American ''technical'' office in Hanoi - in a building the Vietnamese openly set aside for this purpose some years ago.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 1-   A long-sought meeting between President Reagan's special envoy on Americans missing in action in Vietnam and newly installed Vietnamese leaders began here today, but with scant hopes of real progress on either side.  ''I have no illusions,'' the Foreign Minister Deputy Prime Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, told reporters this afternoon at the French-built palace that is the Government guest house. He was waiting to greet the envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey, Jr. General Vessey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was an officer in the Vietnam War.  Mr. Thach said there was no chance the United States would be permitted to open a technical office in Hanoi to speed up the process of searching for missing Americans unless Hanoi gets an office in Washington. The two countries have no diplomatic relations, or interest sections in each other's capitals.  'Two-Way Traffic'  Mr. Thach said an American request for such an office would mean that he would ''have to reciprocate.''  If such a request were made, he said: ''I will raise my desire to have an office in Washington. So you see it is a two-way traffic.''  General Vessey declined to answer when asked if he was authorized to make such a request.  At the same time, Vietnamese officials said today that they were intending to broaden the talks to include ''humanitarian issues'' of their own.  The opening session lasted barely an hour today, and recessed until Sunday morning, when the meeting may end, or be adjourned to Monday, if there is enough reason for further talks.  Diplomats here from both Western and Soviet-bloc nations are virtually unanimous in saying that Vietnam attaches a very high priority to gaining American recognition. They say they are watching the talks for signs of whether or not communication between Washington and Hanoi can be improved under the government of a new Vietnamese communist party general secretary, nguyen van linh.  Hanoi has sent conflicting signals to Washington in the last few years. Discussions on resolving the cases of more 2,400 Americans missing in action in Indochina, 1,776 of them in Vietnam, began to make substantial progress in 1985 under the American leadership of Richard Childress, the National Security Council's director for Asian affairs. In January 1986, when joint excavation of crash sites had almost become routine, Vietnam said it had ''Started the clock'' on a two-year deadline to resolve the issue once and for all.  But within a few months, while in the throes of preparing for leadership changes and scrambling to institute economic reforms, Vietnam suddenly turned negative toward the United States. By the fall of 1986, when remains were last returned to the United States, all but superficial communication had stopped.  Hanoi's Conclusion  Southeast Asian diplomats familiar with developments in Vietnam say that Hanoi had concluded it was getting nothing in return for its cooperation, despite its protests that this was a strictly humanitarian gesture.  President Reagan, under pressure from a lobby calling for action on the issue of the missing, appointed General Vessey his special envoy in January. It took until the end of may for Vietnam to agree to this visit.  General Vessey came to Hanoi today with Mr. Childress, Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, David Lambertson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Asia and the Pacific, Robert Kingston, former director of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii, and Stephen Croker, an aide to General Vessey.  Diplomats here say the visit can be used by the Vietnamese as a demonstration of American interest, whether or not anything is achieved in the talks. Who comes to whose court is traditionally of great importance in many Asian societies.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 2 1987 ,2
"   , Vietnam, Aug. 2   United States and Vietnamese negotiators looking for ways to resolve the issue of 1,776 Americans still listed as missing in this country met briefly twice today.  Vietnamese officials were more optimistic after the talks this morning than they were on Saturday at the outset.  At a break between the sessions today, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told reporters the two sides had reached ''a better understanding'' on the issues.  Diplomats here say the talks will indicate how a new Vietnamese leadership under Nguyen Van Linh, the Communist Party general secretary, will be able to deal with Washington.  Mr. Thach, now also a Deputy Prime Minister, is thought to be one of the more influential members of the new administration.  The American delegation, led by John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to comment on any aspect of the talks, except to say there was more work to do.  This morning, when asked if a planned news conference would still be held on Monday, General Vessey, who is President Reagan's special envoy, brushed aside the question.  ''I don't know if you can expect one,'' he said brusquely. He also canceled plans for sightseeing in Hanoi today.  A previously unscheduled meeting of technical advisers was called for this afternoon. Technical meetings have in the past usually planned crash-site excavations or the returns of war dead.  There has been no decision about whether the higher-level talks will continue on Monday, when the American team is due to leave Hanoi.  ''The talk will resume when we are ready to resume,'' General Vessey said.  Remains of American war dead were last returned to the United States last fall. A resolution of the issue was interrupted, in part, by preparations for the change in Vietnam's leadership.  Many American officials, including most, if not all, on the team now in Hanoi, believe that Vietnam is holding several of the American war dead to be doled out as talks move toward what the Vietnamese hope will be eventual diplomatic recognition.  Few United States officials - and no Hanoi-based European diplomats -believe that any Americans are being held captive in Vietnam. But the Reagan Administration is under pressure from those who claim to have knowledge of such captives and say the Government is doing nothing to free them.

"    JOSE, Calif., July 29   Despite their pride in noteworthy social and economic gains and the reality of rapidly growing political influence, the war has not ended for many Vietnamese refugees here.  ''I have a responsibility and a duty as an American,'' said Ho Quang Nhut, a San Jose insurance agent who was a philosophy teacher in Saigon before he became one of the first ''boat people'' to escape to Malaysia with his wife and children in 1976. ''But in my heart, my family and friends are still there. How can I forget?''  Support of resistance movements against the Communist Government of Vietnam remains a top priority for many of those who fled the country after the ''Day of Shame,'' April 30, 1975, when Saigon fell to the forces of North Vietnam. Some express concern, however, about the growth of intolerance among refugees for anything short of outspoken anti-Communism and support of covert United States military aid to guerilla forces. #80,000 Registered Voters The role that the Vietnamese refugees should play in United States politics is a pervasive subject of debate in ''Little Saigon,'' where the opening of more than 300 businesses over the last five years has transformed a downtown neighborhood once dotted with vacant storefronts. The number of Vietnamese in the city is now approaching 10 percent of the population.  Mr. Nhut, now 48 years old, is one of three co-chairmen nationwide of the League of Vietnamese Voters in the United States. Of the more than 500,000 Vietnamese living in this country, approximately 80,000 are registered to vote, most of them as Republicans because that party is perceived as more stauanchly anti-Communist, Mr. Nhut said. The organization expects to add another 60,000 to that total in the next four years.  Mr. Nhut said that his group recently lobbied some Republican members of Congress for military aid to the ''freedom fighters'' they believed were poised to attempt an overthrow of the Vietnamese Government from within the country with the assistance of troops training along the border regions with Laos and Cambodia. It was their ''bad luck'' to have raised the issue at the time of controversy over aid to the Nicaraguan contras, he said.  Scooped Local News Media  In recent years a number of incidents in recent years have galvanized the anti-Communist sentiments of the refugee community. In 1985, a group of militants attacked a San Jose bookstore run by the Socialist Workers Party.  The most recent occurred in June, when a news program on Vietnam Liberty Television, which had begun broadcasting the first privately produced half-hour nightly news program in Vietnamese from a small office in nearby Santa Clara, scooped the local news media.  The story involved Tom Hayden, a State Assemblyman and former anti-war protester who had traveled to North Vietnam in the war, who had been asked to give the commencement address at San Jose City College, a two-year community college with a large number of Vietnamese-American students. As chairman of the subcommittee on higher education, Mr. Hayden was scheduled to speak on the topic of the future of the community college system.  The speech was canceled after Vietnamese-language newspapers editorialized against it, saying that Mr. Hayden and his wife, Jane Fonda, were partly responsible for the Communist victory. Some militant leaders threatened a demonstration, saying they would not guarantee it would be nonviolent.  Hayden Is Assailed  Nguyen Tiep, a San Jose attorney who is considered a moderate and whose name is frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for political office from the community, was one of the leaders in the protest. Mr. Tiep, a 41-year-old former captain in the legal research department of the Saigon police, was the first Vietnamese-American on the Santa Clara County Republican Central Committee.  ''This is not a freedom of speech issue,'' he said. ''He is a traitor.''  Mr. Tiep also led a group advocating a total boycott of the college by Vietnamese students who he said made up more than 20 percent of the students, a formidable prospect in a time of declining enrollment in this state's community colleges.  While the threatened boycott was called off after college administration apologised, Mr. Tiep said that Vietnamese students would still boycott classes taught by faculty members who assisted Mr. Hayden in making a brief surprise appearance at the ceremony.  Mr. Hayden, who said he believed his right to free speech was violated in the college incident, has also expressed concern in interviews about reports of resistance activities by former generals of the South Vietnamese military. ''I think that they have a clandestine network that is not monitored and for all anyone knows is operating outside the law,'' he said.  Often Meet at Restaurant  About 30 former generals living in the area form an association known as the Dien Hong, which meets regularly for activities that its members say are are strictly social. The Dien Hong includes such members as Do Kien Nhieu, a former brigadier general and the last mayor of Saigon, and Bui Dinh Dam, a former major general in Vietnam and now a social worker in San Jose.  They often meet at a Vietnamese restaurant in nearby Mountain View, which is owned by Dr. Nguyen Ton Hoan, who was vice premier of the Republic of Vietnam in 1964 under Gen. Nguyen Khanh and a leader in the Dai Viet or ''Greater Vietnam'' party. He is not a member of the Dien Hong.  ''We are organizing an international movement to support the idea of a free Vietnam,'' Dr. Hoan, 70, said. ''But it is too early to talk about the resistance. It's not the right time.''  Lai Duc Hung, a former captain in the South Vietnamese Army who now lives in San Jose and serves as the general secretary of the Coalition of Nationalist Vietnamese Organizations of Northern California, a group representing 52 organizations, said the Dien Hong was part of the coalition.  ''Some of the organizations are secret,'' Mr. Hung said. ''There are a lot of things we cannot talk about.''  Representatives of three of the four resistance groups in Vietnam are part of the coalition, Mr. Hung said. ''We try to create a chain for people to contact them,'' he said, ''but we don't collect money. They have an account to send money to.''  While acknowledging that there are some ''radical views'' within the community, most leaders appear to regard them as inevitable.  ''The wounds are so deep they cannot forget and cannot forgive,'' said Nguyen Manh. ''It will remain with them a long time.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 3 1987 ,0
"   , Vietnam, Aug. 3   An American special envoy left Hanoi today with no progress reported in three days of talks on Americans missing since the Vietnam War.  Without some forward movement on the issue, the Reagan Administration has said, there can be no hope of improving relations between the two nations. Washington continues to refuse diplomatic recognition to Hanoi 14 years after United States forces withdrew from Vietnam and 12 years after the fall of the south.  A five-paragraph statement issued at the end of the talks indicates that cooperation between Hanoi and Washington on accounting for the missing has not recovered even the momentum it had achieved two years ago, when the two sides had begun to meet regularly. Talks were interrupted last year while Vietnam went through a leadership change.  Today's closing statement, read by a Vietnamese interpreter, said only that two technical-level meetings would be held ''in the near future'' - one to discuss how to step up accounting for missing Americans and the other to address ''certain urgent humanitarian concerns of Vietnam.''  The leader of the American delegation, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, refused to answer questions from reporters.  Vietnamese officials also declined comment, leaving the impression that this was the wish of the American side. Repeated recesses called by the Americans this morning for private consultations indicated that there was trouble with even the wording of the final statement.  No Linkage of Issues  In what may have been a concession to the Americans, the joint statement said both sides agreed that humanitarian issues ''should not be linked to broader political questions such as normalization or to economic aid.'' There had been speculation among foreign embassies here that Hanoi was considering reviving demands for war reparations.  Two years ago, the United States won agreement from the Vietnamese to hold at least six meetings each year on the missing-in-action issue. In January 1986, Hanoi followed that with a promise to begin a two-year program to resolve the issue once and for all. The deadline is now five months away, and officials on both sides refuse to comment on what will happen when it passes.  More than 2,400 Americans are still missing in Indochina, 1,776 of them in Vietnam or off its shores. While most if not all are presumed to have died, there has been no final accounting of their cases.  More than a million Vietnamese are still thought to be unaccounted for. Among other problems left behind by the war are war widows, orphans, the children of Vietnamese mothers and American fathers and people said to be suffering from chemicals for defoliation of forests and and other purposes. There are also a large number of handicapped people, both civilian and military.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 4 1987 ,2
"   , Vietnam, Aug. 5   Vietnamese officials expect to open talks with the United States before the end of this month that will for the first time address Vietnamese problems arising from the war, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official said today.  ''For the last 12 years, we have handled humanitarian issues for the United States,'' the official, Nguyen Dy Nien, a Deputy Foreign Minister, said in an interview in his office here referring to the accounting of the 1,776 Americans missing since the war.  ''I think now the United States must - has already made a start to - deal with the humanitarian issues of Vietnam,'' said Mr. Nien, an expert on United States affairs. ''We can not carry on one-sidedly.''  Officials close to talks last weekend between the Vietnamese and an American team led by President Reagan's special envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., say that the American side balked at agreeing to a future meeting on strictly Vietnamese concerns.  Action 'Is Important'  ''In negotiations sometimes there is only one word in the text and it can take hours to remove it and replace it with another word,'' Mr. Nien said when asked about the American attitude toward talks on Vietnam's human casualties. ''But I told the American side that the important thing is action.''  ''We would like to close this chapter as soon as possible,'' he added. He recalled that in January 1986, Vietnam set a two-year timetable to resolve the issue. He declined to comment on what might happen when that period ends.  The Foreign Ministry official said that Vietnam, one of the world's poorest countries, had limited expectations about what assistance it could get from the United States. The Reagan Administration has ruled out reparations or war damages.  ''The humanitarian issues of Vietnam are enormous,'' Mr. Nien said. ''But we know the limits. We are realistic.''  Children of Servicemen  Mr. Nien said that in the recently concluded talks with the American delegation, the subject of the offspring of Americans based in Vietnam also came up. The Foreign Ministry official said it was his understanding that there might be a separate set of talks on this issue in the near future. Neither side knows how many of these children remain in Vietnam.  But a number of the children are reaching the age of majority, and Anerican humanitarian organizations say that this could make them eligible for military service, particularly since many are street urchins who might be viewed as delinquents.  Mr. Nien said Vietnam's political prison camp population, most suffering for their association with the United States-backed Saigon regime, had not been discussed with the Vessey party. He called this a political issue that was related to internal policies of Vietnam, Three years ago, Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, had challenged the United States to empty the camps. Secretary of State George P. Shultz responded by offering to resettle the political prisoners in the United States.  Visit by Solarz  But when Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, visited Hanoi in December 1984 and asked if Mr. Shultz's offer would be accepted, he was told that the prisoners could not be released unless the United States could guarantee they would not take part in ''anti-Vietnamese'' activities abroad.  Mr. Solarz told Vietnamese officials that rights of free speech in the United States made such a promise impossible.  Mr. Nien said today that he expected that General Vessey would ''keep up contacts'' with Vietnam, although he is not expected to be part of the next round of talks, which will be at the ''technical expert'' level. The Deputy Foreign Minister said General Vessey, a veteran of the Vietnam War, had been cordial but frank in the recent discussions.  Asked if there was a chance that a further round of talks may be held in Washington, Mr. Nien laughed.  ''We are not so optimistic,'' he said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo of Gen. John W.

"    The United States has refused to open diplomatic relations with Vietnam, but officials of the two countries have been talking for years about 1,700 Americans still listed as missing since the United States troops quit the war in 1973. Despite persistent reports that some of the Americans may be alive, no conclusive evidence has been found. Last week, a high-level American delegation went to Hanoi and agreed to add ''certain humanitarian concerns of Vietnam'' to the agenda.  But, in a terse statement, the Americans and Vietnamese said humanitarian issues ''should not be linked to broader political questions such as normalization [of relations] or economic aid.'' ''Technical experts'' will meet soon to discuss ways to speed up accounting for the missing Americans.  John W. Vessey, a retired Army general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed a nine-member delegation of American officials and families of the missing. He declined to elaborate on the official statement. But Nguyen Dy Nien, a Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister, said talks would begin this month. He added that there might be a separate discussion of the Vietnamese offspring of Americans. Neither side knows how many remain in Vietnam, but some are old enough to be eligible for Vietnamese military service, which could compromise their claims to American citizenship.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 6   At the 11th-century Temple of Literature in a quiet Hanoi park, there are three gates leading to the inner courtyard. The ornate one in the middle is for kings. Two modest ones flank it. One is for soldiers and the other for writers and scholars.  ''In ancient times, there were literary mandarins and military mandarins,'' Nguyen Du Chi, an art historian, said. ''But it was the literary mandarins who entered the court first, to advise the king.''  While writers, artists and dramatists interviewed this week about contemporary Vietnam avoided the use of what they call ''feudal'' terms, their message was the same. As the country struggles after decades of war to build a peacetime society, the literary mandarins are again advising the king.  ''We Vietnamese can live without breakfast before going to work,'' said Pham Thi Thanh, founder and director of the Youth Drama Group. ''But our hearts are dependent on the arts.''  Intellectual Ferment  Vietnam, and Hanoi most of all, is in intellectual ferment. Artists are turning to Expressionism, playwrights to self-indulgent, personal themes of relationships gone wrong. The youth group has gone on stage to pillory teachers who sell exam papers.  ''I have been a journalist for 35 years, and this is the most interesting period of all,'' said Huu Tho, an editor of Nhan Dan, the Communist Party daily newspaper. ''In wartime, we couldn't speak our minds.''  ''During wartime, we can say that leaders and writers had to unite ideologically in the cause of national defense,'' Ly Hai Chau, director of a literary publishing house, said.  ''But in peace, the writer can return to a reflection of ordinary life - offering new ideas and being in the forefront of public opinion.''  Little Is Sacred  The change has come in the last year or two, in the company of economic liberalization and a self-criticism campaign before which little is sacred, not even the Communist Party's leadership over the last half-century.  There are limits to expression in Hanoi - except in a small, clandestine publishing world that an outsider cannot measure. And there is a fear among some that the door to expression can be closed as easily as it was opened.  There can be no movement to challenge the Communist principles of the country's founders. Nor would anyone start a campaign against the nine-year-old war in Cambodia that drains already slender resources and asks a new generation of men to risk their lives.  But in a recent book, ''Time Gone Away,'' Le Luu tells the story of an ordinary man defeated by life who describes in flashbacks the failures of his society and his own passivity in the face of those failures. The success of the book is described as sensational.  Change From Within  Vu Tu Nam, director of the Vietnam Writers' Association publishing house, said the book, which appeared last year, could not have been published three or four years ago. At the literary publishing house, Mr. Chau said he was reviewing manuscripts that had been rejected in previous years.  Vietnamese who are sensitive to suggestions they are under Soviet influence say the wave of introspective criticism is not a development that has been forced on the country by Moscow, Hanoi's patron.  Rather, they say, it is something that comes from within Vietnam itself, just as economic changes in the city grew out of five years of experience with ''contract'' private-enterprise farming, or from a reluctant admission that some of the methods that had been used by the south could be applied without damaging the Communist orthodoxy of the north.  In Hanoi, private businesses, which are beginning to expand under liberalized city laws, are drawing families back together into ancestral homes and neighborhoods from scattered cooperatives.  New Currents  Old habits return, even in rough economic times. This year, for example, Hanoi got a gardening club.  The new currents, thus, move in two directions: inward toward a revival of ancient Vietnamese cultural traditions - not only in the arts - and outward for broader links with the world.  Vietnam's poverty, intellectuals say, is creating a stagnating isolationism. A European ambassador here said this disturbs many Vietnamese who remember that this was once one of the most cosmopolitan societies in Asia.  While shelves in Hanoi bookstores groan under the weight of unsold heavy Soviet technical volumes, readers, translators and publishers press on a visitor lists of books by American authors they would like to have - Kurt Vonnegut, William Styron, Eric Segal - or they simply ask for ''anything new.'' They want to go beyond Mark Twain, Jack London and John Reed. Alex Haley's ''Roots'' was a recent success.  Novels in Limited Supply  Contemporary Vietnamese novels and short-story collections are printed in limited quantities because of a shortage of paper, and they sell out almost before they reach the stores. Mr. Chau remarked that Vietnam must be unique in the world in having a black market in its own literature.  At night, the Vietnamese flock to theaters through repeated power failures to see exquisitely costumed actors recreate old plays in auditoriums that are little better than stifling barns.  ''We can be nationalistic, modern, realistic and romantic,'' said Mrs. Thanh, who studied theater in the Soviet Union, as she guided a visitor around the Youth Drama Group's rehearsal rooms. Her aims, she said, were ''to praise love and life'' and to link a new generation of wartime children with their rich, but forgotten past.  ''The best things of Vietnam have been abandoned everywhere - not only in the theater,'' she said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 9 1987 ,1
"      A Presidential envoy who visited Hanoi last week said today that Vietnam insisted it did not have control over any living Americans missing in action from the war.  Nevertheless, the envoy said, Hanoi suggested the possibility that there might be some in Southeast Asia, and the United States and Vietnam agreed that Hanoi would step up its effort to find missing Americans or their remains.  The envoy, John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he would not speculate on whether there are Americans being held involuntarily in Vietnam.  ''There are certainly all sorts of evidence to show that some might be there, but yet it has been a long time since the end of the war,'' General Vessey said.  He said that while the Vietnamese insisted that ''there are no live American prisoners under the control of the Vietnamese Government,'' they ''acknowledged that there are some wild parts of their country.''  ''The suggestion is that it is possible for there to be live Americans in Southeast Asia, not under the control of the Vietnamese Government,'' he said. ''That is the inference that I draw. They did not say that.'' Three Days of Talks He talked with reporters at the White House after briefing President Reagan on his three days of talks in Hanoi with Vietnamese officials on the issue of Americans missing in Vietnam. He was appointed President Reagan's special envoy on the matter last January.  He said the United States and Vietnam agreed that Hanoi would speed its efforts to find missing Americans or their remains, and that Washington would send experts to Hanoi to look into ''humanitarian concerns that the Vietnamese have,'' such as war orphans and people incapacitated by the fighting.  ''We agreed that we would address these as humanitarian concerns and not link them to broader political issues, such as normalization of diplomatic relations, resumption of trade or economic aid,'' he said.  More meetings will be held in Hanoi at the end of the month on the issue of the missing and the humanitarian issues, he said.  There are 2,413 Americans missing in action in Indochina, 1,776 of them in Vietnam.  General Vessey said Vietnam had agreed to pursue 220 cases involving missing Americans, including 70 cases on which the United States has compelling evidence that an American was alive after being reported missing.  ''We have people who were seen parachuting close to their forces, most probably captured,'' he said. ''Those men did not return, nor have their remains been returned.'' In another case, a picture of a wounded American was published during the war in a Vietnamese newspaper, yet he did not return and his remains have not been recovered.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Aug. 20   As American hopes of restarting a legal emigration process from Vietnam have been rising over the last month, Vietnamese officials here appear to be putting obstacles in the path of agreement.  In an interview Wednesday, Luu Van Tanh, vice director of the Consular Affairs Bureau, which handles emigration here, said that only family reunification cases would be considered in the near future, ruling out thousands of political prisoners or other applicants associated with the former South Vietnamese regime.  The hopes of many Amerasian children may also be affected by what a city official here described as a demand that American fathers claim their children before they will be allowed to leave.  Officials say there may be 10,000 Amerasian children in the country, most of them in their middle to late teens. Many do not know who their fathers were.  Number of Refugees Increasing  The delays over legal emigration comes as the number of people trying to flee Vietnam in boats is increasing in the region, refugee officals say. In Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, people talk openly about arranging passages on these dangerous voyages.  The refugees are one of three rough categories of emigrants at issue between Vietnam and the United States, which have no diplomatic relations. The others are Amerasians and applicants under the Orderly Departure Program, which was begun in 1979 with the assistance of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Under the Orderly Departure Program, Vietnamese can go to France, Canada, Australia and other countries, although most seek American visas for family or political reasons.  Interviews of applicants for Orderly Departure were halted by Vietnam in January 1986. People have continued to leave Vietnam at the rate of about 200 a week, however, as officials clear a backlog of nearly 20,000 emigrants.  Optimistic on New Interviews  After a meeting in Hanoi in July between the American program's Bangkok-based director, Bruce Beardsley, and Vietnamese officials, both sides were optimistic that interviews could resume soon.  Mr. Tanh said the Americans had been asked at the meeting to explain why 4,000 applicants had not received an answer to their visa requests. The United States is reported to have resolved many of those cases, and to have proposed a date to resume interviews.  But Mr. Tanh said Vietnam also wanted to make ''adjustments'' to the overall program, involving office accommodation and interviewing methods. Vietnamese officials say most Western Governments conduct interviews that are too long and demand time-consuming, detailed health screening.  He said this created a ''bad psychological atmosphere.''  Restrictions on Meetings  Mr. Tanh added that American officials would not be permitted to come to Vietnam under United Nations auspices in the future.  ''They will have to come as representatives of the American Government,'' he said. Even so, they would not be empowered to hear cases of released political prisoners, other former associates of the defeated South Vietnamese Government or employees of American organizations in Vietnam.  Those cases would have to be discussed at a higher level he said. He added that this would be among the humanitarian concerns President Reagan's special envoy, John W. Vessey Jr., on a visit to Hanoi this month, agreed to consider in future Vietnamese-American meetings.  In a separate interview, Nguyen Duy Lien, a newly elected Deputy Mayor of Ho Chi Minh City who is in charge of social welfare, said that the resettlement of Amerasians was being held up because ''we must have the father's request'' to let them go.  Sent to Orphanages  Residents of Ho Chi Minh City say that many Amerasian children were rounded up in May and sent to orphanages, labor groups or other institutions. The fact that they have not yet returned to the streets, where many lived by begging from Westerners, indicates that many may be in custody.  Mrs. Lien said Vietnam had created ''all the favorable conditions'' to resettlement of Amerasians, known here as ''con lai'' or half-breeds.  The United States had failed to respond to Vietnam's overtures, Mrs. Lien said. Americans, individually or in relief organizations, say they have offered many ideas to Hanoi on how to move the children, but there has been no follow-through from Vietnam.  Mrs. Lien declined to comment on these American views.  ''I have every right to blame the other side,'' she said. ''No one has the right to blame us.''

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Aug. 20   For more than a decade, a power struggle has been going on in Vietnam that many Vietnamese seem to regard as the final stage of an unfinished revolution.  The picture of this struggle that emerges from several weeks of interviews with officials, journalists and business people in both state and private sectors is partly one of a test of wills between Hanoi's orthodox Marxists - whose ideas of development are rooted in the Soviet Union's Stalinist era or the most radical period of Chinese Communism - and a group of more pragmatic and flexible leaders.  Communism is not being challenged here. But Vietnamese say openly that the party has lost the public's confidence. If it fails to regain this, ''who knows what will happen,'' an editor said.  Inevitably, this clash has involved a broader confrontation between the isolated, undeveloped, agrarian culture of northern Vietnam and the cosmopolitan, entrepreneurial south. Those differences predated the introduction of Communism to Vietnam by Ho Chi Minh half a century ago.  Process Began in 1975  As described candidly by many Vietnamese, the process of unifying the nation seems in retrospect to have begun rather than ended in 1975 with the fall of this city, formerly Saigon. In the end, much that is southern may prevail. But the battle is not over.  In a new atmosphere of outspokenness in Vietnam today, details are emerging of the machinations behind leadership struggles that led in December 1986 to the naming of Nguyen Van Linh, a northerner who spent much of his career in the south, as general secretary of the Communist Party.  Those who have observed the power struggle at close range over the last 12 years tell Orwellian stories of armed economic police sent to ferret out people who were suspected of encouraging free enterprise or otherwise undermining the official policy of total state control of goods and services.  ''We lived in terrible times from 1975 to the early 1980's,'' the owner of a small bakery said. ''We were afraid of everything.''  Editors recount tales of unwritten pacts among journalists to protect vulnerable new political thinkers from entrenched hard-liners.  Old Jobs, New Masters  ''In the first few years after unification, we had certain duties,'' said Tuat Viet, an editor of Saigon Giai Phong, the local Communist Party newspaper. Mr. Viet, a southerner educated in Hanoi who was sent back to the south after 1975, said those duties involved promoting North Vietnamese policies and persuading people here to go on working for new masters with no managerial skills.  Mr. Viet said, ''But by 1978, we began to see the contradictions between improving production and the backward system of management we had. Journalists in this city began to recognize that we needed some changes.  ''In 1975, Ho Chi Minh City was the most developed economy in Vietnam,'' he said. ''But can you imagine that a few years later this city, in the middle of the fertile Mekong Delta, had to rely on grain imported from abroad? People could not accept that.''  Crusading politicians and journalists focused their attacks on a system of state subsidies that was stifling or even reversing economic growth, while leading to large-scale corruption and the abuse of political power.  'Oppressed by Officials'  ''To be frank, we were being oppressed by party and state officials -only they had the power to oppress,'' said Huu Tho, deputy editor in chief of Nhan Dan, the Communist Party daily paper.  The critics also zeroed in on the Ho Chi Minh generation's enthusiasm for large-scale, Soviet-supported industrial and energy projects, which ran counter to Vietnamese traditional economic patterns - and in any case have delivered almost no results.  Vietnam now ranks 161st among 164 nations measured by the United Nations in per capita gross national product, a provincial official in Phu Khanh said in an interview, repeating the figure several times.  In discussing the degree to which Vietnam has swung along behind sucessive Soviet policies, Vietnamese journalists and others say that the struggle between orthodox Marxists and pragmatists was well under way by the late 1970's, before the Gorbachev era in the Soviet Union.  'Vietnamese Are Very Clever'  ''Economic renovation must be in line with with our country's traditional practices,'' Mr. Tho said. ''History tells us if you just imitate others, you fail.''  But Vietnamese add that the example set by the Soviet party leader has been a prop of tremendous value to like-minded people here.  ''The Vietnamese are very clever,'' a Government official said. ''We make use of these Russian ideas for our own purposes.''  For the moment, most Vietnamese say confidently, the pragmatists led by Mr. Linh are not only in control, but also very popular.  Mr. Linh, whom southerners now credit with quietly supporting heretical economic practices - small private enterprises, in particular - while head of the Communist Party here in the late 1970's, was apparently purged from the Politburo by hard-liners in 1982. His return in 1985 marked the beginning of two years of steady change.  Orthodox Marxists Powerful  But followers of the orthodox Marxists, symbolized in most Vietnamese minds by the late party leader, Le Duan, and his immediate successor, Truong Chinh, remain powerful.  Diplomats say Mr. Chinh - the architect in the 1950's of a disastrous attempt at forced collectivization -fought up to the eve of the Sixth Party Congress last year to block Mr. Linh's ascent.  Foreign visitors still encounter old-style party cadres in Government offices - or don't meet known hard-liners because they refuse to be interviewed by journalists from democratic countries.  ''The resistance to change is still large,'' an editorial board member at Saigon Giai Phong said in a conversation at the newspaper office. ''The obstacles are many.'' Among these he listed the entrenched bureaucrats whose jobs may now be threatened.  'Struggle Is Still Complex'  ''The struggle is still complex,'' Mr. Viet said. ''A zigzag route may be unavoidable. But the present trend is clear. This is a demand of 60 million people, 60 million people who refuse to continue living with a stagnant bureaucracy.''  The story of Ngyuen Thi Thi, who is 65, gives life to the political abstractions now being discussed in Vietnam.  Mrs. Thi, who runs a successful food processing network based on smallscale family businesses, is no capitalist. Her Communist credentials are impeccable: a guerrilla at 18, she ran as a courier between the North Vietnamese and their southern operatives.  Her husband was beheaded under the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1959, she said. On her office wall are pictures of her meeting in 1968 with Ho Chi Minh. She is a Socialist Hero with seven medals to her credit.  In Charge of Rice Distribution  But she is also a southerner.  After 1975, when Hanoi moved its team into the south, Mrs. Thi was put in charge of rice distribution for Ho Chi Minh City.  As she visited small outlets around the city, she quickly discovered that many shopkeepers had other skills. She turned over 1,000 of her 7,000 distribution points into small factories that made noodles, cookies, cakes, starch and other cereal.  ''In 1980 and 1981, the Economic Police decided that I was making a mistake by establishing this network,'' she said. ''I was told this was contrary to socialist economic management.  ''One day, about 60 armed police surrounded my office,'' she said. ''But luckily, I did not go to jail. Nguyen Van Linh and Vo Van Kiet were in Ho Chi Minh City then. And they gave me the green light to go ahead.''  Mr. Linh was in disgrace within a year, the victim of hard-liners. But by 1985 he and Mr. Kiet, now head of national economic planning, had re-emerged in major roles, their policies vindicated.  ''The hard-liners are still strong,'' she said, ''but they are unlikely to be able to reverse the present trend.  ''We believe in these new leaders,'' she said, ''because they once shared our difficulties.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 22 1987 ,1
"    FRANCISCO, Aug. 24   Six years of efforts to solve a series of killings and arson fires involving Vietnamese refugees have had one main result: frustration for the law-enforcement authorities here.  A key to the puzzle, officials say, is discovering the identity of a group that says it was meting out ''punishment'' of the victims for pro-Communist acts.  Since the killing here in 1981 of a social worker with leftist sympathies, a group calling itself the Vietnamese Party to Exterminate Communists and Restore the Nation has taken responsibility for killings and arsons its communiques say are aimed at eradicating ''agents of the Vietnamese communists'' and contributing to ''the overthrow of the barbarous and inhumane regime'' in Vietnam.  Motives and Membership Obscure  The authorities in several cities in California say they are not certain that the organization really exists, and if it does, how many people belong to it.  ''There is a lot of speculation as to who they might be,'' said Anthony R. Crittenden, a criminal intelligence specialist with the Asian gangs and organized crime section of the California Department of Justice. ''No one seems to really know.''  The officials cannot even be sure that if the group exists, it is motivated by politics, operating as it does against the backdrop of a community plagued with extortion plots, personal vendettas and organized gangs.  In this environment, even an act as seemingly political as labeling someone a Communist can lie outside politics; among the strongly anti-Communist refugees, such a label can instead be a simple and powerful tool of blackmail and extortion, police officials say.  'It's a Serious Problem'  Based on the sketchy evidence of the group's communiques and a handful of witnesses to the crimes, investigators are now less skeptical than they once were about the likelihood that an organized group is committing the crimes, though the motives are still obscure.  ''At one time we suspected the letters were bogus, but no longer,'' Mr. Crittenden said. ''It's a serious problem.''  Lieut. John A. Woods of the Police Department in Garden Grove, a Los Angeles suburb where a Vietnamese magazine editor was killed earlier this month, said the appearance and style of the group's communiques ''is very, very consistent.''  ''It appears to be an underground group,'' he said, but added, ''it would be nice if someone would come forward and say something.''  'People Were Glad He Was Dead'  Detectives investigating the crimes said the character of the refugee community has presented them with obstacles they would not ordinarily face.  In one case, for example, the killing a Vietnamese social worker was never prosecuted because a district attorney felt that Caucasian witnesses would have difficulty identifying Asian suspects, according to Inspector Napoleon Hendrix of the San Francisco Police Department's homicide unit.  And investigators looking into the case received little cooperation from the Vietnamese community because, Inspector Hendrix said, ''The victim supported the North Vietnamese and the people were glad he was dead.''  In the latest action for which the group has taken responsibility, the Vietnamese language magazine editor in Garden Grove, Tap Van Pham, died Aug. 9 when a fire swept through the magazine's small office where he also lived. Officials said a flammable liquid, probably gasoline, had been spread about and ignited by hand.  Canadian Companies a Target  In a letter mailed from San Jose, 50 miles south of here, and received by two Vietnamese newspapers in Garden Grove, the group said it had burned the building to punish Mr. Pham for accepting advertising from Canadian companies that send money and goods from refugees to relatives in Vietnam. Such companies are seen by many in the community as aiding the Communist Government.  The group emerged on June 4, 1981, when it sent a letter taking the responsibility for a fire that destroyed a company involved in transporting gifts from refugees in America to Vietnam.  Its second communique came after the shooting on July 2, 1981, of a Vietnamese social worker outside his San Francisco apartment by a young Asian man wearing a white windbreaker.  The social worker, Lam Trong Duong, put out a small newspaper that reprinted articles from the Vietnamese Communist Party newspaper, and he collected the poetry of Ho Chi Minh.  'Death Penalty' Declared  After his killing, which has never been solved, a letter was received at a Vietnamese newspaper in Garden Grove announcing that the organization had decided to ''declare the death penalty'' against Mr. Lam and that the killing had been carried out by a member of the group in San Francisco.  The case was complicated by the fact that another group calling itself the Anti-Communist Viets Organisation also took the responsibility for the slaying, asserting it was punishing Mr. Lam for ''odious crimes against Vietnamese people.''  Nine months later, the police arrested a young Vietnamese refugee whom Mr. Lam had befriended and given a job. The refugee was charged with murdering Mr. Lam, but the case was dropped on the day of trial after defense lawyers learned that a key eyewitness changed his mind about the identification of the gunman.  Accusations and Punishment  The organization also said it carried out the shooting of a 72-year-old restaurant owner and his wife, who had willed their estate to the Government of Vietnam ''to heal wounds and to rebuild the country.''  The restaurateur, Nguyen Van Luy, said he and his wife were shot by a young Asian man who stepped out from behind a tree in front of his San Francisco home and said in Vietnamese, ''You came home early today.'' Mr. Luy's wife, Pham Thi Luu, was killed, and the crime remains unsolved.  In a communique postmarked Las Vegas, the Party to Exterminate Communists and Restore the Nation said it had decided to ''punish Nguyen Van Luy by bullets'' and accused him of collecting foreign currency from Vietnamese refugees and sending it to the Vietnamese Government.  The group also said it had been responsibile for shooting Tran Khanh Van, a former South Vietnamese official, who was killed March 20, 1986. Mr. Van was shot in Westminster, a Los Angeles suburb. He had received a threatening letter, a copy of which was also sent to a San Jose Vietnamese language newspaper.  Douglas K. Zwemke, an officer with the intelligence unit of the San Jose Police Department, said Vietnamese refugees have developed more willingness to tell the police what they know about crimes in their community.  ''But they are afraid of retribution,'' Officer Zwemke said. ''My information comes from people with a sense of trust and confidence and they are extremely afraid.''

"   , Vietnam   On the narrow, green coastal plain that winds north from Da Nang to the 17th parallel, once the dividing line between two Vietnams, war stories are told not by soldiers alone.  Some of the fiercest fighting of the ''American war'' took place here, and every adult is, to one degree or another, a veteran: the 50-year-old Buddhist monk in his vegetarian kitchen; the poet, an aristocratic woman of 78, tending her orchards; the young man, barely 30, who sailed away in a rickety boat 10 years ago and has come back to embrace the parents who suffered because of his choice, and the former soldier from Hanoi, still heartbroken by the loss of his first love, who married another while he was at war.  In early 1968, at the time of Tet, the lunar new year, Hue and Da Nang were at the center of a fierce offensive, a campaign that is now regarded as an attempt by Hanoi to conquer the northernmost southern cities.  The former North Vietnamese soldier, now living here, and others say troops had been sent into the area in 1967 to prepare for the campaign. Hue seemed ready to fall; it had been a center of Buddhist and student protest against the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem, who was assassinated after a coup in 1963.  American and South Vietnamese troops dislodged the Communist forces in more than a month of heavy fighting, and Hue and Da Nang remained in Saigon's hands until the war ended in 1975.  Residents of Hue are unexpectedly neutral when speaking with an American about the events of 1968. Outside and occasionally inside Government offices, the battles are called simply ''the war,'' not the standard ''American war of aggression.''  One Government official in a coastal town south of here said people understood that many Americans had come here to fight for something they believed in. Sometimes, the Vietnamese seemed to be blaming Americans less for what happened here than Americans blame themselves.  While a provincial official in Hue, recounting the city's architectural history, told a visitor that ''nothing was added in the 30 years of the puppet regime,'' townspeople pointed to the American-built roads, the bridge linking two halves of the city across the Perfume River, the Hue Central Hospital, and the Huong Giang Hotel, once American officers' quarters and now the focus of the city's plan to build a tourist industry.  People in Hue also say they are aware that American forces made a difficult decision to spare the temples and palaces inside the walls of the 19th-century Citadel, Hue's landmark. They acknowledge that the complex was used by Hanoi's army and the Vietcong to shelter troops and store ammunition.  War Continues to Kill  The Tet campaign continues to exact a deadly toll, said Nguyen Dinh Ngo, the lieutenant governor of Binh Tri Thien Province, of which Hue is the capital.  ''Even this very minute, while we are sitting here talking, somewhere in the province someone is getting killed by the war,'' he said.  Mr. Ngo said 4,000 to 5,000 people have died in peacetime defusing or stumbling on unexploded ordnance. Thousands of bombs and mines have yet to be discovered, he added.  Mr. Ngo said another 230,000 have been affected by toxic chemicals.  Mr. Ngo did not identify the chemicals, and this was not an area sprayed by American defoliants. A few American scientists - especially Dr. Arnold Schecter of the State University of New York at Binghamton - are trying to help the Vietnamese clarify and analyze the type and extent of chemical exposure they may have suffered, a corollary to work being done in the United States on Agent Orange.  Emotional Damage Continues  The young man returning from a new life in the West - under Hanoi's recently relaxed attitude toward ''boat people'' who want to visit home and family - said the war had an effect on more than bodies and buildings. It had altered the psychology of the people he remembered, he said.  This young man said that on this trip, for the first time in his life, he quarreled with his mother. He had chided her for behaving uncharitably to members of the family, he said.  ''She said to me - and she was angry - 'You have no idea what life has been like here, and you can't tell me what to do,' '' he recalled.  In the garden of a spacious riverside family compound, Nguyen Dinh Chi took a different view. Tong Chi, the pen-name by which she is known, said that little has changed in Hue except that the Vietnamese people are finally free.  Mrs. Chi was the wife of a mandarin in Hue in the court of the last kings of Vietnam. She was among those who made the decision after 1968 to join the rebellion against Saigon and the Americans. After the end of the war, she came back to her family home and began to turn its orchards into a sustaining business.  This year, she spent six months in France, visiting relatives. She hopes to visit Boston, where a sister lives, but that will have to wait until diplomatic relations are established between Hanoi and Washington, she said.  At the 17th-century Bao Quoc pagoda and monastery, the abbot, the Venerable Duc Thanh, recalled the American era kaleidoscopically.  Two-thirds of his monastery was destroyed by American bombing, he said. He avoided the question of why this happened. At another pagoda, someone said matter-of-factly: ''The VC were there, and who could tell the VC to leave?''  Hundreds, possibly thousands, of people were reported killed by Communist forces during the Tet offensive because they refused to cooperate, or had been singled out earlier as potential obstructions. Officials here deny the charge, or refuse to discuss it, as do ordinary Vietnamese, who say only: ''The people know what happened.''  'They Were Good People'  Many of Hue's Buddhist temples became part of the war, by choice or circumstance. It was from the Thien Mu Pagoda that the monk Thich Quang Duc went south to set fire to himself on a Saigon street - a widely publicized act that brought world attention to Vietnam in 1963. Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the war.  The car in which the monk was driven is now up on blocks at the pagoda, on permanent display, complete with a picture of the immolation.  On the other hand, the Venerable Duc Thanh, whose monastery is famous for its vegetarian kitchen, orchids and bonsai trees, recalled how young American soldiers came to his temple to learn Zen Buddhism. ''They were good people,'' he said. ''I have heard there are many Zen temples in America now, and I would like to visit them one day.''

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   Vietnam, falling further and further behind its free-market Southeast Asian neighbors in development, is about to begin an ambitious two-track investment campaign.  Officials appear willing to deal with just about anyone with capital but are placing special hopes on tapping the accumulated wealth of the hundreds of thousands of ''boat people'' and other exiles who now live in the West.  Vietnamese emigrants, being wooed with nostalgia, already play a large role in the newly liberalized ''family economy,'' supplying relatives with goods to sell in local markets and mom-and-pop businesses. They also send machines, tools and parts for small industries. Such shipments, along with dollars, are now allowed to enter Vietnam almost without limit. Emigrants are also allowed to return for visits.  Western nations restrict trade with Vietnam and give it no official aid, in protest of the presence of 140,000 Vietnamese troops in neighboring Cambodia, which Vietnam invaded in 1978. Vietnam and the United States have no diplomatic relations.  The Bureaucratic Maze  At the heart of the development campaign is a new investment code, which Hanoi says will be ready by the end of this year after having been tied up since 1984 in what now appear to have been political disagreements. The new law is intended to remove many bureaucratic barriers that have made doing business here virtually impossible for most Westerners.  The new investment climate, the Vietnamese say, will also be enhanced by recently enacted statutes that greatly liberalize both individual and official Vietnamese dealings with the non-Communist world.  Until a change in Government leadership over the last year began to place economic pragmatists in the Communist Party leadership, Hanoi had one of the most isolated and orthodox systems of any Communist country.  Ideologues from the relatively backward North, it is now conceded, destroyed the economy of Vietnam, making it one of the world's poorest nations. Reliable statistics are virtually nonexistent, but the nation's per capita income is thought to be under $175 a year and the inflation rate is believed to be 600 to 700 percent.  'Many, Many Complaints'  ''We have had many, many complaints about our bureaucracy, and we know we must improve,'' Luu Van Dat, director general of the Research Institute for Foreign Trade and the coordinator of the new code, said in a meeting with reporters in Hanoi.  ''The code will simplify investment,'' he said. ''The foreign investor will deal only with one oversight committee headed by a high Government official. He will not have to go to many offices.''  Mr. Dat is confident that Vietnam will find foreigners who are interested in ''our abundant products of land and sea,'' especially tropical fruits and shellfish. Asked who would back him this time if politics intrudes, he pointed to the ceiling and said, ''Now I can go right to the top.''  The top includes a new party general secretary, Nguyen Van Linh. A northerner, he appears to have been much influenced by a long career in the South, first as Hanoi's overseer of the Viet Cong during the war with the United States and later as party leader after the fall of Saigon, since renamed Ho Chi Minh City.  Clash With Hard-Liners  Mr. Linh's sympathies for southern-style economics and its active private sector may have nearly removed him from power in the early 1980's, when hard-liners had the upper hand in Hanoi.  At least as important to sustaining change are Vo Van Kiet, the director of state planning, and Vo Chi Cong, the new chairman of the Council of Ministers, or President. Vietnamese say Mr. Cong, when he was agriculture minister, quietly tolerated free-enterprise farming on a wide scale.  Mr. Dat, outlining the new code, said Vietnam would welcome both private investors interested in joint ventures and investment by the subsidiaries of foreign companies. He also said it would allow contracts for resource development - oil is a priority in this energy-poor country -and for the building of a tourism industry. Tourism is one area where the expertise of ''overseas Vietnamese'' with experience in restaurant management and hotel and other service industries is being actively sought.  Goal of Industrialization  Much of the hope for industrialization with foreign help is centered on Ho Chi Minh City. As Saigon, the city had a relatively high standard of development and entrepreneurial talent before it fell to Hanoi in 1975.  The city has its own Import-Export Corporation and a consular office that allows it to bypass Hanoi in some cases. For foreigners, Imexco is often the best place to make exploratory contacts with the Vietnamese.  Imexco's new director is Nguyen Van Hoang, who until a few months ago was Vietnam's trade representative in Singapore, where much unofficial business is done. He said in an interview that the South was the acknowledged finance center of Vietnam, with a good deal of technical equipment remaining from the days before the North took over.  Mr. Hoang said that during the last year and a half, local governments had opened the way to expansion by light industry.  The city planners are focusing on handicraft export - artisanship is of high quality in Vietnam, but the country's isolation has allowed marketing to deteriorate - and the manufacture of consumer goods for the home market as well as for barter with other socialist economies.  Other Factories Opening  Garment and shoe factories and some electronic assembly lines are also being introduced.  Although Vietnam's new investment law is said to include tax incentives and the promise that profits can be repatriated, some potentially troublesome areas remain. These include the granting of resident permits for business executives and setting the number of foreigners allowed to supervise operations here.  An Eastern European who has worked on joint ventures said many bitter lessons were learned from turning over too much of an operation to local managers. Skills are low, and corruption and theft have been rampant. The Government is conducting a campaign against theft, but temptations are great in a land so poor.  A drive by the Japanese for a head start under the new investment law is leading to ethical problems, Vietnamese say. Would-be Vietnamese partners are learning to seek Japanese ''gifts'' - from exotic calendars to motor scooters and, occasionally, cars or trips to Tokyo.  New Attitude Spreading  A Western European business executive said that mentality had become widespread in the last year or two. As an example, he mentioned the drivers assigned to foreigners. Occasionally the drivers demand Western cigarettes and, if denied them, slow down or refuse to provide services already paid for.  Vietnam's intrinsic problems are monumental: Most manufacturing is done in primitive conditions in deteriorating plants. Hygenic standards are low. Workers at a frozen-food factory were seen sorting cuttlefish on a concrete surface that also serves as a driveway for trucks. Throughout the country, water is unsafe to drink.  Roads in Vietnam are few - the best were built by the Americans -and in bad repair.  Fuel and utility supplies are, at best, unreliable. A journalist's scheduled visit to some of the small private factories here, on which so much hope is being placed, was canceled because electricity in the entire neighborhood had been off for two days.

"      Administration officials say the United States will officially encourage charitable assistance for Vietnam in exchange for increased cooperation from Hanoi in resolving cases of Americans missing in action during the Vietnam War.  Although the agreement, worked out with the Vietnamese last month, falls short of Hanoi's request for economic aid or war reparations, it is the first time that Washington has agreed to provide Vietnam with anything in return for help on this sensitive issue. It also marks an expansion of United States relations with Vietnam.  Without publicity, two doctors specializing in artificial limbs and other prosthetic devices and the head of an international charitable organization held talks last week in Hanoi where they had gone as an official United States delegation.  Report on Humanitarian Needs  Based on its findings, the Administration intends to issue a report detailing the humanitarian needs of the Vietnamese. It will focus on the thousands who require prosthetic devices as a result of the war as well as those since crippled by disease.  As a result, the Administration expects the Vietnamese to cooperate more fully on solving the issue of military personnel still listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War. Officials said they are especially hopeful that Vietnam would be able to provide information to help clear up about 70 ''very compelling'' cases.  ''This means we crossed a line we never crossed before,'' said a senior official familiar with the dealings with the Vietnamese.  Resulted From Vessey Visit  United States officials had steadfastly refused to discuss economic assistance or war reparations as part of the talks about the missing servicemen. As a compromise, Washington will facilitate aid from private groups, which are now prohibited by a long-standing trade embargo.  The agreement was the result of a visit last month with senior Vietnamese officials by John W. Vessey Jr., a retired general, who led a special delegation to Hanoi to discuss the missing. The Administration will issue regulations providing exemptions to trade restrictions that will allow licensing of private organizations to provide charitable relief.  ''When the United States Government gives its blessing to this, we're saying that they're no longer a pariah,'' said the official.  'An Area of Accommodation'  Administration officials also depicted the agreement as an important step in successful negotiations with Vietnam. ''This provides an area of accommodation, of reconciliation,'' said one official. ''If they're smart, they won't try to leverage it into any kind of official recognition. If they try to use it as an opportunity and not a weapon, it can be promising.''  The United States has been seeking Vietnamese help in determining the fate of more than 2,400 servicemen who were listed as missing in action or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps. American officials earlier expressed exasperation in negotiating with Hanoi, accusing the Vietnamese of stalling, in hopes that the discussions would include the normalization of relations and economic aid.  Shultz Aired Pessimism  Before Mr. Vessey left for Vietnam, Secretary of State George P. Shultz expressed pessimism that a breakthrough could be achieved. ''Humanitarian reciprocity is one thing,'' he told a veterans' group in July. ''But any attempt to trade information on our missing men for economic aid is another and we cannot agree to this.''  The category of artificial limbs was chosen as ''a particularly suitable first step,'' according to someone familiar with the negotiations. Artificial limbs and prosthetic devices are ''something tangible, something the Vietnamese can look at.'' He added, ''It's also especially appropriate after a war characterized by landmines and grenades in which many people were disfigured.''  According to some estimates, there are 60,000 amputees in Vietnam as a result of the war. There are also thousands of young people paralyzed from polio, according to one official.  The Administration hopes to have Vietnamese cooperation on what are known as ''discrepancy cases.'' Officials described those cases as those in which a serviceman did not return home after having been sighted alive after being taken prisoner, such as by fellow prisoners-of-war in a camp or in photographs of prisoners.  Dropped Its Insistence  American officials also say that Vietnam has dropped its insistence that they would no longer discuss the issue beyond next January. In January 1986, the Vietnamese said they would begin a two-year program to deal with the issue of American servicemen missing in action once and for all.  Hanoi says that more than one million Vietnamese are unaccounted for from the the war and that among the problems remaining are war widows, orphans, defoliated forests, destroyed villages and children of American servicemen.  The team that returned this week included Frederick Downs, the chief of the prosthetics service of the Veterans Administration; Dr. Carlton G. Savory, a Georgia orthopedist, and Larry E. Ward, who has had long experience in international relief organizations.  According to the National League of Families of American P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s, Vietnam has returned the remains of 170 identified servicemen since 1974, of which 94 have been returned during the Reagan presidency.  Many American officials are deeply resentful at what they believe is Vietnam's intention to dole out the remains of other servicemen as talks progress.  A more intriguing, but murkier issue, is whether any American servicemen remain alive in Vietnam. Vietnam has asserted that it has no other prisoners and has no knowledge of any remaining live Americans in the country. Few United States officials officials believe that any Americans are still being held prisoner. But it is possible, officials say, that some Americans voluntarily remained behind.

"      A Communist Party committee has delivered the first publicized warning to Vietnamese journalists not to be overzealous in their criticism campaign.  At a meeting in late August of editors and party leaders at nine newspapers, none apparently in the forefront of the anti-corruption drive, a party unit described by the domestic Vietnamese radio service as ''the committee of the bloc of central mass motivation organs'' raised concerns about journalistic methods.  ''There are still shortcomings, which can lessen the effect of various articles, such as the lack of precise details, carelessness in the use of language and excessive criticism,'' the radio report said.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   ''In the information world, there can be no sacred cows.''  The editor of a Vietnamese Communist Party newspaper was speaking. The editor, Tuat Viet of Saigon Giai Phong, is one of a small but influential corps of journalists who say they are changing the way the press thinks and works in Vietnam.  ''There has been a struggle between two points of view: to serve the masses or to serve the mandarins,'' he said in an interview at the paper's offices.  ''Being a Government tool, just printing declarations, is always the easier way,'' he said. ''We wanted to add commentary, criticism, real reporting to this.''  Venality and Sloth  Corruption in the national airline, venal party officials, slothful bureaucrats, inadequately educated doctors, men who avoid military service by marrying officers' daughters, these are only a few of the targets that are attracting the attention of writers and cartoonists.  ''Where are the 300 liters of fuel?'' asks a headline in The Youth Paper, the most daring of the new journalistic breed, in a report on bureaucratic theft.  Another article, ''Good news for drunks,'' notes that the price of almost everything except beer is rising.  A cartoon in the same paper shows peasants confronting a luxury house newly built in rice fields near Hanoi's international airport. The house, like many others, belongs to a pilot who is enriching himself on smuggled foreign goods.  A Trove of Cement and Bricks  The accompanying article reveals details of how Vietnam Airline's former personnel chief used the carrier's overworked planes to ferry construction materials and laborers from south to north, to build himself a villa of princely proportions.  In the process, the official, Ngo Dac Thuong, managed to steal or otherwise procure the following: 14,000 pounds of cement, 2,500 pounds of iron and steel, six cubic yards of stone, 102,800 bricks and a good deal of fancy hardware, the newspaper said.  The Youth Paper, published in Ho Chi Minh City, also produces two newsprint magazines: Youth on Sunday and The Laughter of Youth. All are sellouts, news agents say.  But the editors of Saigon Giai Phong believe they were the first to question the economic policies being forced on what was formerly South Vietnam after Hanoi's victory in 1975. And they are now also the most frank in assessing the potential opposition to change from hard-liners within the Vietnamese Communist Party.  Marxism Still Unquestioned  ''There was time when even news of accidents or robberies was suppressed,'' Mr. Viet said. ''This was not reflecting reality.''  ''Party leaders did not want critics,'' he added. ''They were afraid of public opinion. Leaders feared that to open the door would invite an attack on the whole system.''  No journalist has been reported censored or punished yet in the outspoken campaign for party and government overhaul, which so far has not questioned the fundamentals of Marxism. But some editors have been challenged.  Among them is Gen. Tran Cong Man, editor in chief of the Vietnamese Army newspaper, Quan Doi Nhan Dan. The paper has been on a sustained crusade against general inadequacies of government as well as specific cases of corruption and abuse inside and outside the military.  Role of an Army Paper  Analysts who follow events in the Vietnamese Army from Australia and the United States say that the motive for the paper's campaign may be the army's need to win for itself an influential place in peacetime, when its demands compete with those of other interest groups.  The paper says in its editorials that the army cannot be effective in present economic conditions, because soldiers are undernourished, inadequately fed and skimpily supplied.  General Man said that from time to time party officials go over his head to try to stop articles from appearing. He said reporters are being told to verify carefully reports of malfeasance very carefully, so that there will be no missteps.  At The Youth Paper, the deputy editor, 37-year-old Huynh Son Phuoc, says there are four lawyers on call to check articles for potential legal problems.  The Newsprint Shortage  Vietnam's livelier papers say that it is only a shortage of newsprint that keeps them from increasing size and production runs. Mr. Viet at Saigon Giai Phong - where some journalists from the old South Vietnamese regime are employed - said that his market research indicated the present circulation of 90,000 could easily be more than doubled to 200,000.  The paper losing out these days, readers and journalists say, is Nhan Dan, the Communist Party daily. Under a new editor, Ha Dang, it seems to be slipping back from the bolder days of an editor named Hong Ha. Mr. Ha is now a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Information.  Under Mr. Dang, who refuses to meet journalists from democratic countries, Nhan Dan appears to prefer time-tested topics.  A recent editorial reviewing human rights in the United States announced that the American Government had ''blacklisted'' 34 million of its own people as security risks, and that ''the rights of minority groups and the foreign born, especially those of Asian origin, are brutally suppressed.''  Several Vietnamese with relatives living happily in the United States, shrugged when asked about the veracity of this. ''No one reads that paper any more,'' one said.

"      A spokesman said today that the State Department was not linking progress on the issue of missing servicemen in Vietnam to private charitable aid to that country.  Charles E. Redman, the Department spokesman, said a decision to encourage private organizations to provide aid, especially prosthetic devices for amputees, was not connected to American efforts to obtain information about American servicemen missing since the Vietnam war.  ''We believe that P.O.W.'s-M.I.A.'s is a separate issue which stands on its own merits,'' Mr. Redman said, using the initials for American prisoners of war and those missing in action.  The Administration, according to high-level officials, plans to facilitate private charitable aid to Vietnam. The officials also said they hoped Vietnam would be more cooperative in solving the issue of missing personnel, especially about a group of ''very compelling cases'' said to number about 70.  Accords Reached Last Month  The agreements on both issues were worked out last month with senior Vietnamese officials by Gen. John W. Vessey Jr. a retired general who led a special delegation to Hanoi. After his visit, two official teams traveled to Vietnam, one a medical team to study the humanitarian needs of the country and the other to work on the 70 major cases.  Under the plan for facilitating non-governmental aid, the Administration intends to issue a report detailing the needs and encouraging private groups to provide it. The Administration will also provide exemptions from trade restrictions to license such groups to provide the aid.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 9 1987 ,2

The department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said that the accord followed talks in Hanoi earlier this week and that the United States expected the program to resume ''perhaps as early as several weeks'' from now.  The Hanoi radio, in a broadcast monitored Thursday in Bangkok, Thailand, also reported the accord on the Amerasian resettlement program.  The two countries have blamed each other for halting the program on Jan. 1, 1986. About 3,750 children and 5,400 relatives were allowed to leave Vietnam before the program ended.

"     IN THE JAWS OF HISTORY By Bui Diem with David Chanoff. Illustrated. 367 pp. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. $18.95.  ''IF only'' is more than one of the English language's saddest phrases. Used often enough, it enables historians and especially memoir writers all too easily to duck hard questions such as why wrong decisions were repeatedly made at critical junctures, why opportunities were often lost and ultimately why certain forces prevailed over others.  Such handwringing - and evasion - pervades ''In the Jaws of History,'' an account of the Vietnam War from the losing side. Written by a leading South Vietnamese civilian official who also served as Saigon's ambassador to Washington at the height of the conflict (1967-72), and co-written by David Chanoff, a journalist who has collaborated with Vietnamese on three other books about the war, this memoir offers a game apologia for anti-Communist Vietnamese nationalism between 1945 and 1975. But Bui Diem's insistence that a viable democratic Vietnamese state could have been created with the right set of leaders, the right programs and the right kind of help from the West will not convince many opponents of America's war effort. If anything, this kind of speculation strengthens the case that the ingredients for success never existed to begin with. Born into a prominent anti-French Mandarin family in northern Vietnam, the author, like many young Vietnamese, was drawn into the nationalist struggle as Paris's rule began to crumble during World War II. Though taught history with a Marxist slant by Vo Nguyen Giap, later the mastermind of Communist Vietnam's defeats of France and of America and its Saigon allies, Mr. Diem became alienated by the strong-arm politics of Ho Chi Minh's Vietminh. He had by then signed on with Vietnam's non-Communist independence forces, which he describes in detail as a fairly sizable but disorganized and philosophically directionless lot.  Here the ''if only'' sequence begins, each one simultaneously begging and exposing ever more damning questions about the political movement to which Mr. Diem devoted his life. If only the non-Communists had had Ho's mastery of organizational skills and military strategy; if only they had developed a program or a vision to offer their fellow Vietnamese; if only they could have attracted mass support; if only they had not had to rely on the stubborn French, or on the indecisive Emperor Bao Dai. As Mr. Diem's account makes clear, the fatal pattern of non-Communist Vietnam's politics was set in the 1940's: political and military weakness led to dependence on foreign angels, which reduced the non-Communists' legitimacy for many Vietnamese.  As the author describes his involvement with nearly every non-Communist Vietnamese Government after 1945, the ''if only'' list lengthens. If only Ngo Dinh Diem, South Vietnam's first president, had not been corrupt and autocratic; if only Washington had cared more about democracy instead of stability after its role in Diem's 1963 overthrow; if only America had focused on the relatively clean task of blocking North Vietnamese infiltration instead of completely taking over and intensifying the meat-grinder war in the South; if only President Nguyen Van Thieu had tried to broaden his base of support and take social and economic reform seriously; if only South Vietnam's officials and generals had not been so corrupt. And lastly, during Mr. Diem's final assignment as ambassador at large: if only Congress had permitted the Nixon Administration to keep its promises to punish North Vietnam's violations of the Paris peace accords; if only Mr. Thieu had not blundered militarily in 1975 and sealed South Vietnam's doom; if only Congress had approved the Ford Administration's last-ditch military aid request and enabled the improved South Vietnamese forces to fight on.  YET Mr. Diem shies away from the conclusion suggested by so many ''if onlys'' - that with the exception of the elite circles in which he moved all his life, Vietnam during this period (at least) was for some reason fundamentally incapable of generating political democracy, even loosely defined. Though the author evidently disagrees, he scarcely presents any analysis of Vietnamese political culture and thus neglects this issue.  Mr. Diem ever so reluctantly acknowledges that vital American interests were never at stake in Vietnam. He nonetheless closes by imploring America not to abandon the support of democracy around the world but simply to do the job better than in the past. Yet as they thrash about for the right recipe for intervention and reform in the third world, Americans should ponder this: Washington is full of men like Bui Diem from many countries - humane, moderate, honorable, tolerant, democratically inclined. Should American foreign policy primarily reflect the wish, ''If only they could guide their countries' futures''? Or the reality that they are all exiles?

"    Vietnam: What other place in the world is so much talked about and so little known? In a century of French rule, this country, with some of Southeast Asia's most beautiful terrain, somehow never got around to welcoming travelers in any significant numbers. Colonialism was followed by three decades of occupation (Japanese) and war (French, American and Chinese).  This year Vietnam, poor but at peace within its own borders, decided to end its isolation and put itself on the tourist circuit - a little tentatively, to be sure.  ''We don't promise you wonders,'' its first glossy tourist brochure says. ''We simply propose to show you a country in all its human and geographic diversities.''  But wonders are what you get: dynastic tombs, royal poetry reading pavilions over lotus ponds, mountains of marble, empty white-sand beaches that stretch to the vanishing point.  Moreover, Vietnam's towns, and most of its cities, its byways and landmarks, exude the atmosphere of an Asia that has all but disappeared. Bicycle bells and children's voices create what din there is in most towns. Before dawn along the Perfume River in Hue, and in countless other places, the only sounds are those of temple gongs or church bells.  This is a magic moment for the Westerner to visit Vietnam. People crowd around a foreigner in genuine delight. Until now, most visitors of European descent would automatically be assumed to be Russian, especially in the north and around the large American-built bases at Danang and Cam Ranh Bay, now operated by the Russians.  Tell them you are My (mee) - American - and children accustomed to chanting Lien Xo! Lien Xo! (lee-en so, which means Russian) in a not-very-friendly manner will giggle in disbelief. Fewer than 100 Americans have visited Vietnam this year as tourists, officials say, and most of them were members of study tours or potential relief donors looking at needs.  When questions come, they are direct: How old are you? Are you married? Do you have children? A group of French tourists encountered in Ho Chi Minh City had solved the identity problem by wearing T-shirts that said in Vietnamese: French. An interpreter told the story of a European who dealt with all the recurrent questions at once by having his shirt printed this way:     I am not Russian     I am Swedish     I am 30     I am single     I can use chopsticks.  In Vietnam, hosts and travelers - and one is a traveler, not a vacationer, on this jaunt -are learning together. But in almost any provincial hotel, a mere signal that the service has fallen short, as it invariably does, provokes remorse-stricken faces and a burst of celebrated Vietnamese ingenuity to put things right.  What to see? Vietnam, short of accommodations, transportation and most consumer goods, has designated a few dozen places, grouped around four or five major towns, as tourist sites. Travelers may not wander freely in the country, though foreigners wanting to travel alone by car along prescribed routes can do so, usually at about 80 cents to $1 a mile, including driver and fuel.  All details of the trip must be arranged ahead of time with one of the authorized tour operators in the United States. Flexibility is minimal in Vietnam because services are limited and the bureaucracy is overwhelming.  The selection of tourist sites has been made well, offering a sample of antiquities, natural wonders, varying ethnic regions and several beaches. All tours, ranging from 3 to about 20 days, begin in Hanoi, the capital, or Ho Chi Minh City, the country's largest metropolitan area, still known to most people (and its own tourist board) as Saigon.  In both cities there will be set itineraries and probably no choice of hotel. But the visitor with energy left should also take time to walk the streets unescorted to get a closer look at life. In the last year or two, people in Hanoi have stopped being afraid of contact with foreigners, who are free to go anywhere. Reticence has never been a hallmark of Ho Chi Minh City.  Hanoi is a rundown but architecturally uniform French colonial town - a few Soviet or modern Chinese-inpired buildings notwihstanding, and therefore a potentially more beautiful city than concrete Saigon. Bicycle-powered cyclos ply the streets for a pittance. One can be hired for an evening for a dollar or less. (Vietnamese currency has several values: about 380 dong to the dollar at banks, 550 in tourist establishments and 900 to 1,000 in the private shops of Hang Gai and Hang Gao Streets.)   If you want to sample museums, Hanoi is the place to start. The Fine Arts Museum has an attractive, systematic collection spanning the cultural history of the country. Begin on the top floor of classical artifacts and descend, in more ways than one, to the ground floor of agitprop revolutionary art.  The war museum is also a useful stop. For Americans who think there was only one conflict here, the halls devoted to the struggle against the French and battles with Chinese invaders in 1979 put the ''American'' war in context.  If you visit only one temple in Hanoi, try to make it the Temple of Literature, an 11th-to-15th-century Confucian complex that was Vietnam's first university. Although its grounds are badly in need of restoration, there are in one inner court unique stelae, looking like giant gravestones on the backs of tortoises, which record the country's literary achievements since 1443.  According to Nguyen Du Chi, an art scholar and curator at the Fine Arts Museum, the center of Vietnam's last royal dynasty and the country's classical cultural and spiritual capital, these stelae at the Temple of Literature are the keys to succeeding periods of decorative arts. Scholars go to them for the finest work of any given Vietnamese era.  Few scars of war are visible to the tourist in Vietnam; its cities, including Hanoi, were not devastated by bombing. Deforested hills around Hue, for example, are not the work of defoliants but of woodcutters fueling the cooking fires of an overpopulated country.   When transportation is available, tourists can, however, visit some areas along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which were heavily bombed and defoliated. There are also side tours of the Cu Chi tunnels outside Ho Chi Minh City, where the Viet Cong maintained underground headquarters, as well as of orphanages and war museums in several towns.  Hanoi is where most foreigners first encounter Vietnamese-style private restaurants, which are a thing unto themselves. The food in these small entreprenurial establishments is always better than hotel fare. But the ambiance and hygienic standards might best be described as medieval - some would say disgusting - because of the filth and flies.  If tables are cleaned at all, it is with a grimy rag, and sometimes you can smell the toilets. Mangy cats wander around. The squeamish may not get past the kitchen, which may be on the sidewalk out front. But once inside, there are tasty meals that should cause no problems if you order carefully and eat only hot, freshly cooked food.  Restaurants come and go in Hanoi. The hardy colony of international aid workers and diplomats, some of whom live in hotels, near the central market, which specializes in a fish-and-noodle dish; and Restaurant 202, in a residential-commercial area farther afield, where the largely French menu includes steak. With even a small tourist boom and no reversal of a more liberalized economic policy, restaurants are bound to increase and improve.  Out of Hanoi, or Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's attractions are mostly along its coast, with the exceptions of Hue and the hill resort of Dalat. The seaside scenery is remarkable in its beauty and lack of commercial clutter. This is true even of a busy resort like Nha Trang. However, Vung Tau - a day trip from Ho Chi Minh City -falls short of expectations, particularly on weekends.  From north to south, the sights most highly recommended are Ha Long Bay, near Haiphong, with its unusual rock formations and grottoes; the royal city of Hue, the beach at Danang (a city that seems to be rapidly developing into the country's most prosperous community) and, farther south, the beach at Nha Trang along the stretch of coast where the ancient Kings of Champa reigned. A small collection of Cham towers, or temples, from the ninth century is still standing on a hill above Nha Trang's small harbor.  Hue, where Buddhism thrives in well-tended pagodas, is Vietnam's most architecturally interesting city. It is also a pleasant town along the placid Perfume River, where an old American bachelor officers' quarters has become a tourist hotel, the Huong Giang.  In Hue, by the way, the best place to eat is right in the hotel - not in the air-conditioned rooftop dining room, where most tourists are guided, but in a small, open-air cafe on the ground-floor terrace known as the Specialty Restaurant. This little restaurant, run by a private owner under an unusual (for socialist Vietnam) contract with the hotel, features the local Hue cuisine, the best in Vietnam. While you eat, you can watch life on the river.  Though menus change from day to day in this restaurant, it is usually possible to find a fragrantly seasoned or spiced rice dish. The best may be the Huong Giang rice, which is lightly fried with sesame seeds, aromatic herbs, dried shrimp, onions and chilies. There are also delicious fried meat rolls you construct yourself in thin rice wafers.  Another Hue specialty is the khoai, a folded pancake that looks like a taco, with a bean paste or other filling and garnishes. After dinner, or for a snack, there might be sweet soup, a concoction of sweetened white or green bean paste, lotus seeds or fruits served cold. (Avoid the ones with chopped ice.) Well fed, the traveler can make an excursion around the pagodas, a city museum, the 18th- and 19th-century tombs of the Nguyen Dynasty in the hills outside town and the royal temples and halls inside the Citadel, the old walled city.  Three tombs are of special interest, for their variety and setting. The tomb of King Minh Mang is the oldest of the existing Nguyen tombs, built in 1840-43. All the royal burial places -more parks than mausoleums -were chosen for their tranquil settings.  Another royal tomb in a large park of lotus ponds and pagodas is that of Tu Duc, which was built in 1864-67. Within the grounds it has what is thought to be one of the few private royal theaters left in Southeast Asia. The king did not die until 1883. He had the burial park built early so he could enjoy it while living. One of his favorite pastimes was reciting poetry in a pavilion, where young Vietnamese now come to strum guitars and picnic with friends.  Most extravagant of the tombs is that of King Thai Dinh, built from 1920 to 1931. The tomb is a fantasy of styles: Hindu, European, and Vietnamese, with an interior of brilliant rococo murals made of broken porcelain from all over the world. Outside, a courtyard of life-size stone mandarins, with horses and elephants, awaits the king's pleasure.   A brief stop might be made at Hue's unusual Roman Catholic Cathedral, the Mother of Perpetual Help, which was designed by a Vietnamese architect under the old South Vietnamese regime to give a Christian building local inspiration. Two Redemptorist fathers in their 70's struggle to keep the building going with only the support of their congregation.  South of Hue, through the Hai Van (Sea Cloud) Pass winding through mountains that reach the edge of the ocean, a scenic road leads to Danang. There is a Cham museum here, but it is in need of a good curator.  Danang's beach, in sight of the Marble Mountain, with its lookout points and a cave with a Confucian temple carved into its interior, has the city's newest hotel. Called simply the Tourist Hotel (nomenclature, like bell captains, have yet to be invented here) it is on a long, sandy beach - a good place to unwind and prepare for the next leg of the trip.  Unfortunately, the hotel dining room comes close to serving inedible food and, to make matters worse, cuts off a view of the sea with curtains, leaving already spiritless diners with a view of only the barren room's Early Socialist decor. If you can swing it, here's the place for a picnic on one of the hotel's terraces, or right on the sand.  The next major resort south of Danang is Nha Trang, the rest and recreation lure of Russians now and the Americans before them. The beachfront has been carefully maintained, though many of the town's buildings have deteriorated. The beach here, unlike Danang's, has a special character: It is the town's lively and popular municipal park, where people come at dawn to do exercises and in the evening to enjoy the sea view and the breeze.  Inland from Nha Trang, a bumpy road winds through mountain passes to the Central Highlands and the hill station of Dalat, the French Empire's Simla. Here colonial administrators established a summer capital and built European-style villas on pine-covered hills overlooking a lake.  Lodgings here, more than almost anywhere else (save for Hanoi's Thong Nhat, once the Metropole, and Saigon's Cuu Long, the old Majestic,) have character. The Dalat Palace, a wood-paneled, cavernous genteel resort hotel that dominates the town center, has been lucky. It may have deteriorated physically, but for more than 40 years it has had the presence of Thai Vien. Now 67 and the manager, Mr. Vien, whose career has been unbroken since 1946, remembers the service standards of happier years and has tried to keep the Palace's spirits high against all odds.  For a very few extra dollars, you might get to stay in one of the suites, with old pewter and china still on the shelves, the way it was when guests of another era walked away from Dalat - and Vietnam.  In the morning, on a walk along misty streets with horse-drawn wagons, you can sense that age again. Like the pagodas of Hue, or picnics by the sea, the quiet landscape and relaxed people of Dalat tell a visitor that while so much is radically different now in this country, there is also much of traditional Vietnam that has survived.  PLANNING A TRIP  What to Take  Here are the things to bring along to Vietnam to help avoid frustration:  Medical Supplies. Everything you could possibly need, down to aspirin and bandages. If you are prone to motion sickness, bring tablets for the rough roads and internal flights. Most drugstore items are not available, except on the black market, if then. Also bring insect repellent or mosquito coils, as there is some malaria here, imported from Cambodia, as well as dengue fever. Cholera, hepatitis and tetanus inoculations are often recommended.  Money. A few hundred American dollars in small denominations. Even if the trip is already paid for, you may be charged for extras (excluding food), in dollars. No one ever has any change. Dollars are also used in government handcraft and art shops. Traveler's checks are rarely accepted outside major cities. Credit cards are useless.  Toiletries. Bath soap, shampoo, cosmetics, sanitary napkins, toothpaste and washing powder. If you stay in one place several nights, laundry service will usually be good, however. If you can not live without soft American toilet paper, add that. And bring rubber flip-flops for sloshy floors.  Food and Drink. Bring bottled water. Mineral water is available in some places some of the time, and local beer is safe, if warm. But while you are getting acquainted with the country, especially in hot weather, it does not hurt to have a few bottles of spa water from abroad. Travelers can get very sick in Vietnam, and medical services are minimal. Insist that locally bottled drinks be opened at the table. Also bring antiseptic towelettes. It is never impolite to clean a glass, cup, bowl or chopsticks. The Vietnamese do it with whatever is at hand.  Bring instant coffee, sugar, nondairy creamer and instant soup packets or boullion. All hotels will provide an insulated flask of near-boiling water that can be trusted. You might also bring a thermos for hot or cold drinks on the road. Some people swear by an emergency supply of jam, or tiny cans of fish or pate, with can openers. Canned foods can make a meal with bread and tea or coffee. They are also good gifts.  Cigarettes. They are useful, not only if you smoke, but also to offer as small tokens of thanks to people who will assuredly go out of their way to help you. Remember, however, that some duty-free goods - a few brands of beer, whisky, brandy and cigarettes - can also be bought in so-called dollar stores in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.  Odds and Ends. Film, batteries, an alarm clock, extra pens. Paper products, from a good supply of facial tissues to notebooks, paper or plastic cups and plastic spoons.  Emergency Help  The State Department cautions travelers that the United States does not maintain diplomatic ties with Vietnam. Therefore, the usual consular services, like emergency funds or help in locating missing travelers, are not available. However, Vietnamese tourism officials say that if an American tourist faces any serious problem - an accident or heart attack, for example, the Government will notify the United States Embassy in Bangkok after tending to emergency needs. Most seriously ill foreigners who can do so leave Vietnam as soon as possible for medical care. The embassies in Hanoi of friendly countries - Britain, France and Australia -can also help in an emergency, and there is a French consulate in Ho Chi Minh City.  Crimes - thefts from hotel rooms, muggings, and the like - are almost unheard of.  Vietnam requires visas and can impose stiff penalties for those who enter the country without them. Visa processing is handled through one's tour operator and can take considerable time, up to eight months. (Visas are processed in Bangkok and Paris.) The State Department warns Americans who were born in Vietnam that they may be dual citizens and subject to military service or taxes if they re-enter the country. The advice is to carry only U.S. passports with the proper visa and nothing that identifies the traveler as a Vietnamese citizen.  Generally speaking, Americans are prohibited by the Treasury Department from doing business in Vietnam. However, personal expenditures, like transportation, lodging, meals and the purchase of goods for private use, are not prohibited.

Tour Operators  You can go to Vietnam only on a group tour. According to Nguyen Dang Quang, first secretary of the Vietnamese delegation to the United Nations, the following companies offer tours:  Indochina Consulting Group, 844 Elda Lane, Westbury, N.Y. 11590 (516-333-6662); Go Worldwide Tours, 233 Sansome Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, Calif. 94104 (415-781-3388); Orient Flexi-Pax Tours, 630 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017 (212-692-9550); Philippine Airlines, 556 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10036 (212-575-7850; 800-554-5444); Economy Tours, Post Office Box 18881, Irvine, Calif. 92713 (714-559-5256); Lindblad Travel, Post Office Box 912, 1 Sylvan Road North, Westport, Conn. 06881 (203-226-8531; 800-243-5657 outside Connecticut); Marazul Tours, 250 West 57th Street, Suite 1311, New York, N.Y. 10107 (212-582-9570).  Typical Costs  One 16-day trip to Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, scheduled to depart from Seattle on Nov. 2, is offered by Lindblad Travel at $2,500 a person in double occupancy. The price includes air transportion within Vietnam and Cambodia, but air fare from the United States is extra.  Individually, hotels normally cost between $15 and $35 where there are suites or other special rooms, as in Dalat. (The charges are always in United States dollars.) Food is unbelievably cheap, with the average main-course dish in most places about $1. Food and local beer can be paid for in dong, the Vietnamese currency.    - B. C.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 13   The official Vietnamese press agency said today that Hanoi had ordered the release of more than 6,000 prisoners to mark two anniversaries of national independence.  The agency did not say today what kinds of prisoners were involved in the amnesty, plans for which were first announced in August, or how many had actually been freed.  But today's announcement indicated that more than 300 people associated with the defeated regime of South Vietnam had been released in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.  The report from Hanoi said that among those to be freed were 480 military and civilian personnel of the former South Vietnamese government. Saigon was captured by the North Vietnamese in April 1975, and many people were arrested in the following months.  Many Flee Country  Western diplomats say that prisoner releases are to be expected at this time of year, when Hanoi celebrates Vietnam's National Day, Sept. 2, and the Aug. 19 proclamation of the first Communist government in what was then North Vietnam.  Diplomats also say that the prisoners released may have been sentenced for security or civil offenses. Tens of thousands of political prisoners who were detained but never sentenced are thought to remain in custody.  The periodic release of prisoners in recent years has led to a surge in people trying to flee the country by boat, or overland through Cambodia.  The Hanoi radio's domestic service announced on Aug. 17 that certain groups of prisoners were due for freedom.  Categories for Release  These included people who had served two-fifths of their prison terms and who had ''sincerely repented.'' Other prisoners may have their sentences reduced, according to the August broadcast, including those who had ''reformed themselves well.''  The August statement said that other categories to be released or to have their sentences cut included prisoners who had ''recorded achievements''; people who were old or very ill; those who had ''numerous children,'' or whose children were very young, and those who had parents or others to care for who were too old and without support.  Secretary of State George P. Shultz has offered to resettle Vietnam's political prisoners, most of whom are suffering because of their involvement with a string of United States-backed Saigon regimes.  Vietnam, after first supporting such resettlement, has since backed down, saying that the issue of poltical prisoners needs to be discussed at higher levels.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 16   A former United States Congressman arrived in Bangkok today with six relatives of American servicemen unaccounted for in Laos or Vietnam since the 1960's. The group plans to release 2,500 balloons Thursday with messages offering large rewards to those who can produce a missing American.  The delegation, headed by former Representative William Hendon, a North Carolina Republican, has raised $2.4 million to offer to citizens of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to bring out any American serviceman still alive and in captivity.  ''Nothing else has worked,'' Mr. Hendon said, alluding to more than a decade of negotiations with the governments of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  In Indochina, the United States has diplomatic relations only with Laos, where 549 Americans are still listed as missing. Another 1,776 are unaccounted for in Vietnam.  The group plans to go to northeast Thailand Thursday to inflate the balloons and send them into Laos.   WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 (AP) - The State Department said today that a private group's plan to float balloons in Indochina to advertise $2.4 million in rewards for the rescue of American servicemen could hurt official efforts to account for the missing. The National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, the largest group representing the relatives of the missing, also criticized the effort.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 18   For the first time since Americans fled the fall of Saigon a dozen years ago, United States officials are working in Vietnam. They are consular and immigration officials who have resumed screening Vietnamese applicants for American resettlement.  The screening, which began last week after a long freeze, was resumed after the United States agreed in August to discuss Vietnam's postwar humanitarian needs and the Vietnamese pledged to speed up the resolution of cases of Americans missing in action. Diplomats here said the American move indicated that relations between the two countries could improve substantially under Hanoi's new party leader, Nguyen Van Linh. #1,000 Interviewed Disagreements among local and national Communist Party leaders over whether to proceed with legal emigration under the Orderly Departure Program were thought to have been the cause of a freeze in the screening from January 1986 until now. The freeze also affected resettlement programs of other nations, including Australia and Canada. More than 1,000 Vietnamese were interviewed last week by the Americans, said Bruce Beardsley, who directs Indochinese refugee programs from the United States Embassy in Bangkok and who was part of the American team in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. Only nine applicants were rejected, with about 100 cases awaiting more documentation.  The next round of screening in Ho Chi Minh City is tentatively scheduled for October, when interviewing of children of American and Vietnamese couples is also expected to resume.  Eighty-one of an estimated 10,000 such young people - known as Amerasians - and their families qualify for American citizenship, United States officials said. They said Hanoi has never explained why these people, now teenagers or in their 20's, have not been allowed to emigrate.  About 670,000 Vietnamese are seeking resettlement in the United States, Mr. Beardsley told reporters today. American officials have issued letters of introduction to 95,000 of them, signifiying that they apparently are eligible for American visas. The 95,000 include some inmates of political prisons.  Prisoner Resettlement Ruled Out  The Vietnamese authorities, who reserve the right to decide which applicants will be given exit permits, are limiting interviews to family reunion cases for the moment. They rule out the release of any prisoners for resettlement abroad, saying they remain a political issue that would have to be discussed at a higher level.  But Western and Vietnamese diplomats say a number of officials of former South Vietnamese regimes who would qualify for American resettlement on humanitarian grounds were among more than 6,000 prisoners ordered released by Hanoi last week.  The most prominent of the prisoners freed was Lieut. Gen. Nguyen Huu Co, a former South Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.  The participation of Mr. Beardsley in last week's interviews in Ho Chi Minh City, along with a United States consular officer and a member of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, raised the American involvement to a diplomatic level for the first time. However, no formal relations exist between Hanoi and Washington.  Vietnamese officials said they had been pressing for this change over the last few months. Since the Orderly Departure Program began in 1979 interviewing for the United States had been done by the International Catholic Migration Agency. Other nations with diplomatic representation in Vietnam conduct their resettlement interviews through consular officials.  The procedure used by the Americans delayed the departure process, the Vietnamese said. Interviewers in Vietnam had to relay details on cases to Americans in Bangkok who then made decisions on the applicants.  The United States has resisted establishing any diplomatic presence in Vietnam until all Americans missing in action are accounted for and Hanoi withdraws its troops from Cambodia.

"      The Pentagon, responding to published remarks by a Cambodian leader, said today that if Cambodia held the remains of missing American servicemen, then it should return them to the United States.  The United States will seek, through international agencies, to verify assertions by the Cambodian, Prime Minister Hun Sen, that the Cambodian Government has the remains of many Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War, when American planes bombed Cambodia and American forces sometimes crossed its borders, a Pentagon spokesman said.  The Cambodian official made the remarks in an interview with The Los Angeles Times published on Saturday.  But a Pentagon spokesman, Lieut. Col. James Jannette, said Washington would not talk directly to the Vietnamese-backed Government about the issue because, like most nations, the United States does not recognize the regime in Phnom Penh.  ''We welcome any information on the recovery of remains which are possibly those of American personnel missing in Cambodia,'' Colonel Jannette said, reading from a prepared statement. ''We hope the Phnom Penh regime will cooperate in the return to the United States of any remains it has in its possession.''  'No One in Touch With Us'  In the published interview, the Cambodian leader asserted that the Government has ''the bones of American M.I.A.'s.'' He added: ''But no one has gotten in touch with us, so we have kept them. If the American Government doesn't come, there is nothing we can do about that.''  ''We are prepared to release them on the basis of humanitarianism,'' he said, adding that his Government would not demand recognition from the United States in exchange.  Colonel Jannette said that the United States had inquired several times, through international agencies and through the governments of Laos and Vietnam, whether servicemen's remains had been found in Cambodia and could be returned. He said there had never been any response. Inquiries by an organization representing the families of the missing also elicited no response, he said.  The United States does not have relations with Vietnam, but visits by American officials, including John W. Vessey Jr., a Presidential envoy and retired general, have helped win the return of the remains of missing servicemen.  Prime Minister Hun Sen told The Los Angeles Times that he did not know the precise number of servicemen whose remains were in his Government's possession, but said: ''We have quite a number of them. The numbers will not be a disappointment to the U.S. Government.''  The United States considers more than 2,400 personnel to be missing in action in Indochina. About 82 of these are recorded as missing in Cambodia.  In the interview, the Cambodian leader also said his Government was holding an American Vietnam veteran, Sterling Brian Bono, who disappeared in the region last spring. He suggested his Government was prepared to release him. Mr. Bono is thought to have entered Cambodia looking for a refugee he knew in Vietnam.

"    Huynh Tan Phat, a leader of the Vietcong during the Indochina war and later a senior official in the Hanoi Government, died Saturday in Ho Chi Minh City. He was 76 years old.  Vietnamese officials announced that Mr. Phat would be buried on Thursday in Ho Chi Minh City, the southern capital formerly known as Saigon.  Before the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975, Mr. Phat emerged as the chief theoretician of the Vietcong, formally the National Liberation Front, the southern, Communist-led political movement backed by North Vietnam.  Among Northern Colleagues  After the Communist victory, he was one of the few from the South to hold a leadership position in a Government and Communist Party dominated by northern Vietnamese. His positions included that of vice chairman of the Council of State.  Born in My Tho in the Mekong Delta in 1913, Mr. Phat became involved with the anti-French underground in 1936, after earning an architecture degree from Hanoi University. He was editor of the anti-French magazine, Jeunesse (Youth), and a founder of the Vanguard Youth movement.  In 1945, he joined the rebellion in the Saigon region against the French colonial government, and was arrested by the French on several occasions before going underground in 1949. He became director of the movement's information service and was named to the resistance and administrative committee in the Saigon-Cholon area.  After the defeat of the French in 1954, he returned to Saigon and established an office as an architect, but continued his political activities as a founding member and later secretary general of the Democratic Party. In 1959, he again went underground when the South Vietnamese Government of President Ngo Dinh Diem began to move forcefully against the political opposition.  Senior Positions  In 1960, he was named to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, becoming its secretary general and vice chairman of its Presidium and emerging as chief theoretician.  In 1968, he was named chairman of the Alliance of National Democratic and Peace Forces, another Hanoi-backed grouping, and in June 1969 became president of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam, a shadow government set up by the Vietcong.  There was no report of immediate survivors.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: photo of Huynh Tan Phat (Camera Press)  TYPE: Obituary                      ",October 3 1989 ,0
"    ANGELES   WHEN Nguyen Van Be, once a colonel in the South Vietnamese army, emerged from 13 years in a re-education camp last year, he wrote to his wife in Washington, wondering how to fit into a world that had left him behind. ''He feels he got lost somewhere,'' says his wife. ''He feels like someone from the jungle.''  Now Colonel Be is among thousands of former political prisoners waiting for a chance to move to the United States under an agreement reached last summer. Last week, American officials began interviewing freed prisoners in Ho Chi Minh City, the first step toward bringing the first 3,000 to the United States.  Another 100,000 former prisoners and their families have requested entry into the United States. Vietnamese authorities have put the figure of former prisoners and their families at 500,000.  Resettling this group will be a step toward closing out this nation's debt to its Indochinese wartime allies. ''These people have been detained because of their close association with us during the war,'' said Robert Funseth, the senior deputy assistant secretary of state for refugee affairs, who has spent most of this decade negotiating their resettlement. ''They are of special humanitarian concern to the United States.''  The United States has accepted more than a half million Vietnamese since the first 135,000 fled Vietnam at the end of the war in April 1975. The first were the lucky ones among the South Vietnamese elite, the ones who succeeded in the scramble for planes and helicopters.  During the mass escapes by boat that began in the late 1970's, the United States committed itself to taking 14,000 Vietnamese a month. This exodus included higher proportions of farmers, fishermen, and other villagers, people who did not fit so easily into Western society. There were proportionately fewer ethnic Chinese, with their economic hustle and Chinatown connections. At the same time, the large numbers of refugees began to strain government and private agencies.  Some communities have been transformed by the influx. In California, a state that officials say may be home to nearly half the Vietnamese refugees, the center of Westminster, just south of Los Angeles, is now known as ''Little Saigon.''  The former prisoners, who could begin arriving in the United States before the end of this year, include many former leaders of the South Vietnamese society that the United States was fighting to keep in place.  ''There's going to be a lot of the old political leadership, old generals, old ministers, old party leaders,'' said Dawn Calabia, associate director for refugee affairs at the United States Catholic Conference. ''Some of them are going to be very embittered.''  The Lost and the Tough  Some, said Donald Cohon, a San Francisco psychologist who has interviewed former inmates, are likely to be ''shells of people, brutalized to the point where they are nonfunctional.'' Most, he said, will have suffered years of malnutrition.  But, as Ms. Calabia said, ''Some are going to turn out to be tough as nails, survivors of the worst the Vietnamese could do.''  There will be men like Nguyen Hau, an army major specializing in ordnance, who was released after being severely injured in a camp, fled by boat to Malaysia, arrived in the United States at the age of 52 and immediately went to school, after a lifetime of military service, to study to become a mechanic.  Mr. Hau, who was a mechanic until the small company he worked for folded recently, now heads a nationwide organization of former Vietnamese political prisoners. Based in Westminster, it is one of the groups that are preparing to help survivors of the re-education camps.  Another group, the Association of Families of Political Prisoners, is headed by Khuc Minh Tho, the wife of Colonel Be, a Government clerical worker with two children and a woman with a keen sense of the difficulties that some of the released men will be facing.  In his first letter after his release, she said, her husband asked the question that was on the minds of most of his fellow prisoners: Have you been faithful to me? Are you still waiting for me?  Some of the wives she knows here, Mrs. Tho said, have found new mates. ''They tell me, 'I don't think the prisoners will ever get out of the camps,' '' she said. ''They tell me they give up.''  Even now, women like Mrs. Tho cannot be certain whether their husbands will be allowed to leave the country or will be held back by the capriciousness that has marked refugee releases in the past.  ''I pray,'' Mrs. Tho said, ''that he will be one of the lucky ones.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",October 15 1989 ,0
"    To the Editor:  Donald T. Regan suggests America's drug problem can be cured simply by changing the color of money (Op-Ed, Sept. 18). But that idea was tried before and failed dismally.  Our last currency conversion took place during the spring of 1970. The reasons for changing the color of currency then were the same reasons Mr. Regan suggests for doing it now. However, changing the color of American Military Payment Certificates failed back in crime- , drug- and corruption-infested South Vietnam in 1970 because the American high command didn't appreciate that the major element in the ''evil triad'' paralyzing our war effort was neither crime nor drugs, but corruption.  Used as cash by the American military, the payment certificates replaced the greenback for two reasons: so as not to disrupt the South Vietnamese economy by flooding it with highly valuated American greenbacks, and to prevent the North Vietnamese and the last Vietcong remnants from obtaining an internationally accepted currency to purchase more advanced weapons, support and medical equipment.  But as senior military command and intelligence officers became aware that South Vietnamese drug lords, black marketeers, commodity brokers and enemy arms merchants possessed more payment certificates than American military personnel, a secret plan was hatched to change the color of the certificates abruptly and render impotent the entire ''evil triad'' pyramid: from the politicians and generals at the top who sold stores of spent brass bullet casings back to the U.S. Government, to the street urchins and barrack maids at the bottom who sold marijuana, cocaine, hashish and heroin on our military bases.  Planning for the conversion was kept from military personnel below the rank of division commander. Or so it was intended. As American G.I.'s awoke in the morning and received surprise orders to report to hastily built currency exchanges to replace their color-canceled M.P.C. bills, millions more of the new bills were already in the hands of South Vietnamese brothels than in American currency exchanges. Those of us who worked as liaison with the South Vietnamese Army discovered the night before that many of the lower-ranking Vietnamese soldiers, fronting for their generals or civilian merchants, possessed huge, hand-sized rolls of freshly printed M.P.C.  Was the conversion a failure? The true goal, it seemed, was not to eradicate the evil triad completely but to replace the uncooperative cartels that had become too wealthy and powerful for the American and South Vietnamese high command to negotiate with, with new cartels that promised to work more closely with our war effort. At that late stage in the war, corruption was an accepted basis for a growing, or at least surviving, South Vietnamese economy.  The new cartels, amply supplied with the brightly colored payment certificates, helped American officials buy back tons of black-market PX goods and military and medical equipment, thereby reducing the supplies that would otherwise have ended up in the hands of the enemy, who were caching tons of M.P.C.-purchased munitions along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border to prepare for invasion. Many of the supplies American officials failed to reclaim during the weeks following the M.P.C. conversion were recaptured during the Cambodian offensive.  Was the conversion a success? No. Drug use among G.I.'s continued to soar during the two remaining years of American military involvement. Munitions continued to flow into North Vietnamese caches across the border. And American law enforcement and intelligence morale sank to deeper depths.  Corruption among both South Vietnamese and American profiteers seemed a more potent enemy than the American high command had anticipated. Corruption here at home would spell failure in changing the color of American money.

"   , R.I., Nov. 1   A Vietnamese man who escaped his homeland by riding for two days on the rudder housing of a Cypriot tanker that docked here Monday has been granted temporary asylum in the United States.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service will let the man, Nguyen Van Tuan, 23 years old, stay for one year, a spokesman for Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island said Tuesday. Then it will decide whether to let him apply for permanent residenc.  The immigration service found that Mr. Nguyen had a well-founded fear of persecution if he returned to his homeland, said Carl Krueger, a lawyer from the International Institute of Rhode Island, a private agency that handles immigration cases.  Clutched a Rope  Mr. Nguyen was found crouching on a makeshift plywood seat on the rudder housing, about four feet above the water, during a lifeboat drill in the South China Sea on Aug. 30, said Jerzy Kolasinski, the captain of the tanker. The ship had left Ho Chi Minh City two days earlier.  Captain Kolasinski said that Mr. Nguyen had clutched a rope hanging from the ship and that he survived only because the tanker was empty, keeping the rudder housing above sea level.  Speaking softly through a translator at a news conference Tuesday, Mr. Nguyen said his family was being watched by the Government in Vietnam. ''He didn't know where the vessel would go,'' said the translator, Joseph R. Le.  Mr. Nguyen said his parents and four siblings knew that he was leaving, but he said they had not been told that he is alive. He said he would write them. For now, he will live with Mr. Le in Woonsocket, which has a large Vietnamese community. Mr. Le said the immigrant had already received three offers of jobs and two of room and board.

"      Despite strong objections by President Bush, British Government officials said today that they planned to go ahead with the forced repatriation of Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong, probably starting within the next few months.  Mr. Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain discussed the issue when they met on Friday at Camp David, Md., but reached no agreement. While Hong Kong will give temporary asylum to ''genuine refugees,'' thousands of ''illegal immigrants'' will have to be sent back, Mrs. Thatcher said.  ''Hong Kong simply cannot go on taking them, and they will have to be repatriated as are other illegal immigrants,'' Mrs. Thatcher said at a news conference here on Friday. About 200 have returned voluntarily, and Mrs. Thatcher said she understood that ''they have been well treated.''  About 57,000 Vietnamese boat people are being held in camps in Hong Kong, a British colony that is to be handed over to China in 1997. Thirty thousand have arrived since January. One man was killed and 14 people were injured in rioting at one camp in September. There have been reports of outbreaks of cholera and malaria in other camps.  'We Have No Alternatives'  A British diplomat said today that Britain did not like the idea of returning boat people to Vietnam against their will. But he said, ''Unless everybody volunteers, which is inconceivable, we will have to do the unpalatable thing of returning them because we have no alternatives.''  A Bush Administration official said today that the United States was ''unalterably opposed to forced repatriation to Vietnam unless and until dramatic improvements occur in that country's economic, political and social life.''  British diplomats would not discuss the timing of the forced repatriation program. Michael Hanson, the colony's refugee coordinator, said last month that he hoped the program would be ''in place by the end of this year.'' Other British officials say the program should begin by February, when the new ''sailing season'' starts for Vietnamese boat people.  At the height of that period this year, Hong Kong was receiving 1,000 Vietnamese a day, British diplomats said. The repatriation program is designed, in part, to deter such an influx, American officials said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",November 27 1989 ,0
"   , Calif.   Le Ly Hayslip, a Vietnamese woman who was forced by the hardships of war to collaborate with the Vietcong, dabble in the black market and sell her body, is now presenting hersin a book and perhaps a movie as the face of her country's victimized peasantry.  Her message, directed particularly toward American veterans, has drawn criticism from Vietnamese here. But it has also tapped a well of feelings among former American soldiers, and they have written her about their sense of guilt and nostalgia for Vietnam.  Mrs. Hayslip's memoir, ''When Heaven and Earth Changed Places'' (Doubleday, $18.95), was published earlier this year. American reviewers said it filled a need to hear from the millions of Vietnamese who suffered in the war.  Into the Netherworld  The story, which is now being adapted for a possible film to be directed by Oliver Stone, is about a village girl who like many Vietnamese gives her allegiance to the Communist army by night and the South Vietnamese Government by day.  Danger and poverty forced her into the urban netherworld, where many learned to thrive in an atmosphere of black marketing and prostitution. Like some other Vietnamese women, she found escape by marrying an American. And now Le Ly Hayslip lives here in a ranch-style house on a rolling Southern California hillside.  Mrs. Hayslip has returned to Vietnam six times since 1986 and has formed a nonprofit relief group, East Meets West, which has sent medical supplies to Vietnam. Last month, she opened a clinic in Ky La, the village of her birth, just south of Da Nang.  That clinic was financed by Mr. Stone, who directed ''Platoon,'' the 1986 movie that depicted the Vietnam War from the perspective of Americans who fought and died in it. Mrs. Hayslip said she hopes he will be able to film her life story on the dirt paths and in the small thatched houses of her own village, with her relatives and friends there participating.  Her book, written with the help of Jay Wurts, a California writer and editor, was greeted with some hostility in Vietnamese emigre newspapers. They questioned her story and voiced suspicions about her sympathies. The reaction reflects the highly factionalized and politicized nature of the Vietnamese community in the United States.  Mrs. Hayslip says her story speaks for itself and is not unusual. Her politics, she says, are the politics of reconciliation and healing after decades of division.  Fourteen years after the war ended, she said, Vietnamese may have had more success than American veterans in coming to terms with the hardships that some of those veterans inflicted.  Back in Vietnam  Back in Vietnam, talking quietly with her family in the meager light of an oil lamp, she asked, ''What did you get out of all this war?''  ''They turned around and said, 'We are happy,' '' she went on. ''I told them, 'You are all poor.' They said: 'It seems poor because you come from a rich place. This is the same house you were born in and you are eating the same fish from the same pond.' ''  American veterans are less at ease with their experiences and their feelings, she said. A man in prison wrote that he had entered ''a life in crime'' after serving in Vietnam. Another man, divorced and at loose ends, offered to take his skills as a bomb-disposal expert to Vietnam to sweep for unexploded ordnance.  A third man, who fired artillery from a hilltop at people he never saw, recalled in a letter to Mrs. Hayslip his daily view of his target.  ''I often sat on a bunker and with a pair of field glasses looked at the people planting and transplanting and harvesting rice,'' he wrote. ''In the morning the mist would settle in the valleys, the sun's rays would reflect the mist and we would be surrounded by 1,000 lakes.''

"    KONG, Dec. 2   Hong Kong, straining to house the tens of thousands of Vietnamese boat people who have arrived in the last 18 months, is making final arrangements to force them to return to the country they risked their lives to escape.  As British negotiators in London work out the final details of the repatriation plan with Vietnamese officials, this British colony has been considering ferries, charter planes and even a floating casino to take the Vietnamese home. Government officials said this week that the first forced repatriations could begin before the end of December, and will be carried out in secret.  A British Government official said that while London and Hanoi have a general agreement on what they have agreed to call ''the orderly return program,'' they must still devise a way to monitor the resettlement of those who will be sent back, and work out logistical arrangements.  The Cost of Resettlement  Eventually, Hong Kong hopes to send back some 40,000 Vietnamese who fled the despotism and poverty of Vietnam, sailing across the South China Sea in tiny open boats. Newspapers here and in Britain have reported that Britain will pay Vietnam $600 per person to cover the cost of resettlement.  A Hong Kong official said the plan was to return the first group of Vietnamese quickly and in secret, ''for security reasons.'' He said the press ''will be informed after the fact.''  ''We can't have the date of the first departure leaking out because that could cause widespread rioting in the camps here,'' he said. There have been reports that the first forced repatriations will be carried out under dark.  British officials say that Vietnam, eager for diplomatic acceptance and foreign aid, has agreed to accept the forced return of its citizens but has warned against articles and photographs featuring weeping Vietnamese.  ''I don't think the British want publicity on this either,'' a relief worker said. ''It doesn't enhance the British image, does it? Forcing people at gunpoint onto boats and planes at Christmas time.''  A Sense of Haste  A Hong Kong Government official said that while ferries and ships were being checked, ''we cannot rule out the use of planes for the first few trips because we need to move quickly, the minute the ink dries on the agreement with Vietnam. ''  A ship's surveyor hired by the Government here to inspect the Macmosa, which carries vacationers between Macau and Taiwan, said the gambling ship had been rejected because there was not time to put bars on all the portholes and divide the ship into small, cell-like spaces.  The Government official said: ''In the long term, we will be looking to use ships because of the sheer numbers involved and because they are safer. Obviously, an aircraft is riskier if the Vietnamese cause a disturbance.''  The Screening Process  Hong Kong now houses about 57,000 Vietnamese, only 13,000 of whom are considered refugees and await resettlement in a third country. The remaining 44,000, who arrived after a June 16, 1988, cut-off date, are undergoing a strict screening process and are treated as illegal immigrants unless they can prove they fled political or religious persecution. Only a small percentage of them are expected to do so.  The boat people live behind high barbed-wire fences, crowded into squalid camps patrolled by armed guards. The camps are closed to news organizations, and even relief workers have limited access.  Government officials have said they want to begin the forced returns soon to discourage more Vietnamese from sailing here before the good winds begin in March. Most of the Vietnamese here are poor fishermen and farmers from the north, and almost a third are young children.  With pockets of Vietnamese already staging demonstrations and hunger strikes to protest the return plan, security officials here have drawn up contingency plans for widespread rioting in the detention centers when the first group has departed.  The American Position  The United States, which this year settled the largest number of Vietnamese from Hong Kong, has opposed the mandatory repatriation plan, asking that voluntary repatriation be given more of a chance. President Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain discussed the issue when they met a week ago at Camp David, Md.  A Bush Administration official said the United States was ''unalterably opposed to forced repatriation to Vietnam unless and until dramatic improvements occur in that country's economic, political and social life.''  British officials, who argue that Americans routinely force illegal immigrants from Mexico and Haiti to go home, say they have no alternative.  Despite the strict screening criteria, the poor conditions of the Hong Kong camps and the slim hope of resettlement, the Vietnamese keep coming. Hong Kong officials say a voluntary program begun last March under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is not working. Only 600 boat people have returned voluntarily, with 130 more flying back on Thursday. About 1,000 volunteers await processing by Vietnam for return, officials said.  Group of 72 Is Readied  A group of 72 Vietnamese, moved out of the larger detention camps and isolated in Phoenix House, an old factory building converted into a holding center, is widely expected to be the first to be sent back. Members of this group have been refusing food for days.  ''We still do not have a date, or even the numbers of Vietnamese to be returned on the first trip,'' said a senior Government official familiar with the Vietnamese problem. ''But that group in Phoenix House has been prepared -been coaxed, you might say.  ''Everyone there was screened out and lost their appeal of the decision. They were then moved to Phoenix House, where they were visited by representatives of all the major resettlement countries - the United States, Canada, Australia - and told they had no chance of being accepted by those countries. They were told that unless they went home, they could spend the rest of their lives in that old factory.''

"      A senior British Government official said today that there would probably be no more deportations of Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong to Vietnam this year.  ''My guess is we will be into the new year before they start again,'' he said.  But the official stressed that no planned deportations have been canceled and that the Government is not changing its plans in the face of international criticism of the involuntary repatriation of 51 Vietnamese from the British colony on Tuesday. The 51 people were the first to be forced to return.  ''It will continue,'' the official said of the deportation program.  Asked when the next involuntary deportations might occur, a Foreign Office spokesman said: ''We have no dates. There are no immediate plans for further ones.''  There will be two more flights of people who have volunteered to return to Vietnam, leaving Hong Kong before the end of the year, a Government official added. Each flight will have as many as 120 returnees, with the first leaving Dec. 21 and the second probably after Dec. 25, he said.  According to British officials, 630 volunteers have already returned to Vietnam in the last year. They consider that low rate a failure, which is why the Government resorted to forced repatriations, they said.  British leaders said on Tuesday that they must press ahead with the involuntary repatriation program as a deterrent to people in Vietnam who are now thinking about illegally going to Hong Kong in the hope of using it as a stepping stone to a better life in the West. The busy season for emigration typically begins in about two months.  There are about 57,000 Vietnamese in detention camps in Hong Kong. The British Government has said that some 4,000 of those have been through a screening and appeals process and have been determined to be economic migrants who will be returned to Vietnam. But as many as 40,000 are ultimately expected to be deported as economic migrants who are not genuine refugees fleeing from persecution.  Demonstration in Hong Kong  HONG KONG, Dec. 13 (AP) - More than 6,000 Vietnamese held in detention centers here demonstrated today against the involuntary return of 51 other boat people to Vietnam, a Government spokesman said.  Some shouted that they would rather die than return to Vietnam, local radio and television stations reported.  About 3,000 Vietnamese marched around the camp on the outlying Hei Ling Chau island, a former leper colony, and another 3,000 demonstrated at Whitehead camp in the New Territories. About 300 staged a protest at the Chi Ma Wan center on the offshore Lantau island.  The demonstrations were peaceful and none lasted more than two hours, said Lionel Rodrigues, the Government spokesman.  Vietnam, in a commentary monitored in Bangkok, partly blamed economic embargos imposed by non-Communist nations for the flight.  The broadcast cited a ''policy of hostility and economic sanctions'' pursued ''by some against Vietnam over the last 10 years as one of the reasons causing economic difficulties in Vietnam.''  ''This led to the fact that some people fled the country,'' the broadcast said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 14 1989 ,0
"   , Thailand, Dec. 16   Vietnam opposes the forced return of boat people who sought refuge in Hong Kong and reserves the right to send them back to the British colony, the official Hanoi press agency said.  The agency said on Friday that a Foreign Ministry official delivered a note on Vietnam's position regarding the boat people to Emrys Davies, Britain's Ambassador in Hanoi.  A Foreign Office spokesman in London said today that Britain would not comment because it had not received confirmation of what the note said.  First Group Accepted  A group of 51 Vietnamese was flown from Hong Kong to Hanoi on Tuesday in the first forced repatriation.  The Vietnamese authorities accepted the group and said the refugees would not be mistreated, but officials also criticized the forced repatriation program.  According to the agency, the Foreign Ministry note strongly rejected forced repatriation and said Vietnam would only accept ''those who volunteer to return or who are not opposed to the repatriation.''  It said the ministry official cautioned Ambassador Davies that ''any violation of these principles may hamper and even completely disrupt the process of cooperation to resolve this problem step by step'' as agreed to at a conference on Indochinese refugees held in Geneva in June.  Reserves Right to Return Them  According to the agency, the ministry official said that ''if Vietnam discovers any case of 'forced repatriation,' it reserves the right to return them to Hong Kong.''  Many of the 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into Hong Kong since June 1988 are considered illegal ''economic migrants'' unless they can prove they fled their Communist homeland to escape persecution.  Thousands have demonstrated to protest the decision by Britain and its colony to force the return of the refugees, a decision criticized by the United States.

"    A chorus of angry, righteous protests have been stirred by Britain's hard-boiled decision to forcibly bundle 51 Vietnamese boat people onto planes bound from Hong Kong to Hanoi. Governments, relief agencies, the European Parliament and now Pope John Paul II have joined in denouncing what is plainly an inhumane act.  Though Prime Minister Thatcher insists that the policy stands, the outcry has elicited a seasonal concession - no more deportations until after the Christmas holidays.  Yet those who criticize Mrs. Thatcher have not squarely addressed certain awkward realities in a poignant human tragedy. Most of the Hong Kong refugees have been driven from North Vietnam as much by poverty as by an oppressive political system. And the British are not wholly wrong in asserting that the exodus will continue as long as Vietnamese face hunger and joblessness at home.  The U.S. condemns forcible return as ''odious'' but won't provide homes for the boat people or lift a finger to change the conditions that impel them to flee. This moralism smacks of hypocrisy.  When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, the United States responded with a total embargo that sharply curtailed Hanoi's exports of raw material. Successive Administrations set several conditions for ending the embargo and establishing ties with Hanoi. They included withdrawal from Cambodia and progress on finding 2,500 U.S. servicemen still listed as missing in action in Indochina.  In September, Vietnam completed its withdrawal. Progress has been made on the M.I.A.'s. Washington now says this is not enough. It wants Hanoi to support a Cambodia policy few can understand, much less defend. That policy would force Hanoi's allies in Cambodia to share power with the mass-murdering Khmer Rouge. Vietnam has refused, and as punishment its application for an International Monetary Fund loan has been blocked by the United States.  Two courses are open to President Bush if he is to give moral and political content to American preaching about the boat people. He can take the lead in urging industrial countries to provide a home for all 50,000 refugees now in Hong Kong camps. And he can lift the U.S. veto on lending to Vietnam, whose wretched conditions are partly the result of economic sanctions.  Otherwise, Mrs. Thatcher can with some justice dismiss U.S. objections to British policy as the irrelevant mutterings of Uncle Humbug.

"    KONG, Dec. 29   The police raided a Vietnamese refugee camp today and clashed with stone-throwing boat people who reportedly feared that they would be forced to return to their homeland. Officials said 40 people were wounded.  The police fired tear gas after the Vietnamese set fire to blankets and threw rocks to prevent a search for homemade weapons, a Government spokesman, Timothy Li, said. Twenty-seven Vietnamese were arrested and more than 700 weapons were seized, the police said.  Television showed policemen equipped with helmets and shields firing tear gas, and smoke from the fires could be seen rising above the center on outlying Lantau island, which houses more than 3,000 Vietnamese.  ''The boat people, in order to make the operation more difficult, pushed their women and children to the front,'' said Security Secretary M. Geoffrey Barnes.  Reports on Repatriation  The violence came one day after clashes broke out between Vietnamese at another center, in which one person was killed and 10 others were hurt.  The Government-Financed radio reported that the resistance may have been set off by reports that some of those in the center may be in the next group of boat people forced to return to their impoverished homeland.  Earlier this month, the Government returned 51 Vietnamese to their homeland against their will in the first such repatriation.  Although officials refused to say how many police officers joined in the operation, the radio put the number at 300.  Brawls Between Rival Gangs  The police said tonight that 14 Vietnamese and 26 guards and policemen were wounded in the camp.  The officials said five hours of counseling by staff members of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and voluntary agencies failed to persuade the Vietnamese to cooperate.  The police reported two clashes Thursday night between Vietnamese armed with homemade weapons at the Shek Kong Detention Center, in which one person was killed and 10 others were hurt.  The police said they were investigating the cause of the brawls between two rival groups from Quang Ning. About 100 people were involved in the fighting.  Homemade Swords and Lances  The police have classified the case as homicide. The wounded at Shek Kong ranged in age from 16 years old to 28, and one was hospitalized in poor condition, the police said.  No arrests were made at Shek Kong, but the police found homemade weapons like swords and lances in the detention center after the battles.  According to the police, five people have died this year in factional fighting that erupts frequently in the crowded and squalid Vietnamese camps.  About 44,000 boat people who have sailed into Hong Kong since mid-June 1988 and are considered illegal immigrants unless they can prove they fled persecution. Those who are denied refugee status and have their appeals rejected can volunteer to go home or face forced repatriation.  The 12,000 boat people in Hong Kong who arrived before the screening program took effect were automatically granted refugee status and are awaiting resettlement overseas.  The eighth group of boat people to volunteer to return to Vietnam flew back to Hanoi today. The 111 people who took the chartered flight bring to 874 the number of boat people who have returned home voluntarily since March.

"    KONG, Dec. 30   With the next forcible return of Vietnamese boat people expected within two weeks, Hong Kong officials disclosed today that refugees inside detention camps here have drawn up resistance plans that include setting fires, arming themselves with homemade weapons and taking hostages.  Officials got a preview of the opposition they may face when they tried to search a camp for weapons on Friday. Boat people there, fearing that they were being rounded up for repatriation, stoned the police, jammed the locks on the camp gates and set huge bonfires at both entrances. A camp official said the boat people continued to resist even when warned that the police ''might be obliged to open fire on them.''  Officials said the Vietnamese began preparing to resist the police after the first repatriation on Dec. 12, a step that prompted wide international criticism. Hong Kong, which has 56,000 boat people, fewer than 13,000 of whom are considered refugees awaiting resettlement in a third country, hopes to repatriate tens of thousands of Vietnamese over the next few years.  Knives Made From Bed Slats  When the police arrived on Friday at the Chi Ma Wan camp, Vietnamese armed with knives made from metal bed slats lined up along the camp's wire fence, poking their weapons through the mesh. Some hauled out pots of water and soaked towels and scarves to use as masks when the police threatened to use tear gas.  Officials said resistance was so fierce that before they could gain control of the camp and enter to conduct their search, scores of tear gas cannisters were fired and hundreds of extra police were called in, some of them armed with shotguns. The police said 14 Vietnamese and 26 guards and police officers were wounded.  A top official in charge of guarding the camp, I. K. Bhagat, said once the weapons search was completed and the Vietnamese could see that no forced returns were planned, ''life immediately returned to normal, and everyone had their evening meals, children were running around playing.''  Today, the authorities said the camp, on an island near Hong Kong Island, was quiet. But in a news conference today, at which some of the 700 homemade weapons confiscated at the camp were displayed, Mr. Bhagat and Barry Deegan, a top police official, painted a dark picture of mounting resistance inside detention centers. The Hong Kong Government does not permit reporters inside the camps.  Almost Daily Marches  Mr. Deegan, deputy regional commander of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force, and the man who outlined the tactics the Vietnamese were believed to be planning, said ''all we have feared came to pass, except the hostage-taking.'' He said that since the first group of relatively docile Vietnamese was sent home, there have been almost daily marches and demonstrations inside the detention centers and ''tensions are high.''  According to Mr. Bhagat, assistant commissioner of the Correctional Services Department, intelligence reports from inside Chi Ma Wan said that many of the 3,200 boat people there were ''manufacturing a large number of weapons and storing them because of the fear they would be repatriated to Vietnam.'' He added that the Vietnamese ''said they would use these weapons against any forced repatriation.''  The camp, which houses the largest number of Vietnamese ''screened out'' as non-refugees and thus candidates for forced repatriation, is normally patrolled by 15 to 24 prison guards, half of whom are women.  Mr. Bhagat said the guards often see the Vietnamese fashioning weapons now but are afraid to take them away, adding: ''The boat people say to them, 'We will only use these when the police come for us.' ''  Relief workers and prison guards inside the camps have said that each night the Vietnamese go to sleep to the steady grinding sounds of metal being sharpened into weapons. And they said many Vietnamese now sleep in their shoes so they can run if the police come to send them back.  International Criticism  The first group of Vietnamese to be sent back to Hanoi against their will was made up of 51 boat people, most of them women and children, who were put aboard a plane under heavy guard in a secret, middle-of-the-night operation. Officials said that while more than 100 police and prison officers were involved in escorting the 51, no physical force was used and the operation went smoothly.  Still, the forced return of the boat people prompted international criticism, especially from the United States. Moreover, Vietnam, edgy and concerned about world opinion, said it would accept boat people who were made to return, but not if any physical force was used against them.  Relief officials today said that distinction was clearly understood by the Vietnamese in camps here. ''They know now they have nothing to lose, and they are willing to fight,'' said a relief worker, who asked not to be named. ''They are going to resist any way they can.''  When the police finally took control of Chi Ma Wan and began a hut-to-hut search for weapons, they encountered ''a large group of hysterical females'' who were so upset by the idea the police were coming to send them home, they ripped off all their clothes. The wailing and mass hysterics ''proved so bad, we had to leave hut No. 7 and search it at the very last,'' Commander Deegan said.  Mr. Bhagat said he envisioned more violence as the repatriations continued, but refused to discuss what measures would be needed to control the Vietnamese. A senior Government official, who asked not to be named, said that the riots and resistance ''changed nothing,'' and that the repatriations would continue.  He said the authorities would simply seek out docile Vietnamese and leave ''the tough nuts'' for later. The official refused to speculate on what might happen should the more militant Vietnamese try to violently block the police from sending back the less militant, saying, ''Let's cross that bridge when we come to it.''

"    ''I HAD SEEN ENOUGH OF MY American colleagues of the press,'' says the narrator of Graham Greene's 1955 novel, ''The Quiet American.''  ''Periodically, after an engagement had been tidily finished and the casualties removed from the scene, they would be summoned to Hanoi . . . addressed by the commander-in-chief, lodged for one night in a press camp, where they boasted that the barman was the best in Indochina . . . and then delivered safely and noisily back, like a school treat, to the Continental Hotel in Saigon.''  Renowned as a haven for journalists - cynical, pampered and otherwise - during the decades of war in Indochina, the Continental Palace was built by the French a century ago. Generations later, it became a casualty of neglect following the fall of Saigon (since renamed Ho Chi Minh City) in 1975. For years, the hotel, a city landmark, lay vacant, gradually becoming overgrown by moss and weeds.  Its restoration, being carried out by Vietnamese architects working from old drawings and under the auspices of Saigontourist, a Government agency aiming to entice Western visitors back, was begun in 1987. Arches and colonnades are being reconstructed and the facade repaired; Vietnamese artisans are restoring interior details.  According to a representative of a Manila-based construction company involved in the project, the hotel will reopen at the end of this year. The ''new'' Continental, he said, will have 71 rooms, two restaurants and a dance hall.  He estimated the total cost at between $4 million and $5 million and said that upon reopening, the hotel will be Vietnam's most expensive. An overnight stay will cost $60 to $120.

"    ANGELES, Aug. 16   A quarter-century ago, when Doan Chau Mau was one of Vietnam's best-known movie actors, he played, he said, ''the heavy, the bad guy, the Vietcong's colonels.'' Now, Mr. Doan is again playing a Vietcong officer -on a made-for-television film - but it is a gentle, humane officer, a sympathetic character. Between the two roles there lies a vast gulf of time, distance and perception.  Mr. Doan's is appearing in a segment, ''The Last Soldier,'' of ''Vietnam War Story: The Last Days'' on Home Box Office. It is to be broadcast on Saturday at 9:30 P.M. The portrayal is the first lead role for the actor, now 72 years old and silver haired, since he escaped from Saigon in 1975, just a day ahead of advancing Communist troops. He was afraid, he said in an interview here, that his portrayals of vicious Communist officers, would have made him a natural target for reprisals.  But for Mr. Doan and several other Vietnamese actors who played in the television drama, written by a Vietnam veteran, Patrick Duncan, whose feature film ''84 Charlie Mopic'' received generally favorable reviews earlier this year, the experience was a mixed one.  They Call It a Breakthrough  All of the actors were clearly happy to be acting on the American screen, playing the kinds of roles that generally have been given in the past to non-Vietnamese actors - Filipinos, Chinese and others. Indeed, they described ''The Last Soldier'' as a breakthrough; it is the first time that a drama involving only Vietnamese actors, played by Vietnamese actors, will have been done on American television.  And yet, the making of ''The Last Soldier,'' which is part of the HBO series entitled ''Vietnam War Stories,'' illustrates the author's often different views of the war held, on the one side, by the bitterly anti-Communist community of Vietnamese refugees in this country and, on the other, by Americans like Mr. Duncan who are seeking a more nuanced, less stereotyped view of the former enemy.  For Mr. Duncan and the director of ''The Last Soldier,'' Sandy Smolan, the task was to depict the tragedy of war in which ordinary men on both sides are forced by governments to kill one another. The writer and the director are seeking to understand the former Vietnamese enemy, not as what Mr. Smolan calls ''the vicious stereotypes that are always part of the propaganda of war,'' but as human beings.  Their Roles and Ideas  ''This is the first time,'' he said, ''that somebody has shown the other side sympathetically.''  The Vietnamese actors in ''The Last Soldier,'' however, all fled their country precisely because they did think, and most of them still think, that the Communist enemy was an implacable foe whose goals and methods were irreconcilably different from their own.  ''As an actor I can play any role,'' Mr. Doan said. ''But I am very sad.'' ''Even in Patrick Duncan's film I have to say one line. I say that the Vietnamese Army stole our rations and our children are hungry. From the American point of view the Vietnamese National Army was only thiefs and cowards. I would like to play in something that praises the Vietnamese soldiers who fought against the Communists.''  What HBO will show on Saturday is in fact three separate half-hour films. The first two of the episodes were written by Mr. Duncan and they were directed by Luis Soto and Mr. Smolan. The two are what the American film makers describe as a ''Rashomon'' technique showing exactly the same episode taking place in the final days of the war from two different points of view.  One Side's Viewpoint  In the first program, a group of Vietnamese soldiers and their American military advisers deal with a pesky sniper who almost daily opens up on their hilltop redoubt. The American and Vietnamese soldiers are plagued by low morale - one of them has become a drug addict and dreads the end of the war and his return home - and drastically inadequate supplies of ammunition.  The second episode shows the situation from the perspective of the snipers themselves, a small band of South Vietnamese who once were farmers but who took up arms when the Americans destroyed their village. The group, led by the character played by Mr. Doan, is exhausted by the war. Its members dream of peace and home. In the end, both sides suffer casualties as they act out the roles assigned to them by the irresistible force of the conflict that has made them enemies.  For Mr. Doan the very notion of a sympathetic Vietcong officer that he plays is a historical inaccuracy. His character is a gentle, aging, reluctant soldier who cares for a lost 11-year-old nephew, played by an American-born Vietnamese actor, California Xuan Tran, and striving to stop the men in his charge from taking unnecessary risks.  ''I am an uncle,'' Mr. Doan said of the character he plays. ''I have a nephew with me and I take care of him. That's quite different from the VC in Vietnam. In Vietnam, the VC didn't take care of anybody, no family, no relatives, no nephews, nobody. They took care only of their party. They obeyed the orders of the party, that's all.''  'I Played a Real VC'  ''In Vietnam,'' he said, speaking of his acting career there in the late 1960's and early 1970's, ''I played a real VC.''  In some ways, the views of the war among Vietnamese actors and American film makers mirror the very ''Rashomon'' effect that the latest episodes of ''Vietnam War Stories'' use as a cinematic technique. Mr. Duncan, who was a forward observer in Vietnam in 1968 and 1969, said that his observation of the enemy led him to ''see the humanity of the people you are about to kill.''  ''That's always stayed with me,'' he said. ''I've never had a great hatred for the Vietnamese people, South or North, and I thought it was time to do an episode that expressed that feeling.'' The Vietnamese actors hired by HBO had their own experiences of the war. Mr. Doan, for example, who now lives in Seattle, was twice a refugee. A native of a northern village not far from Hanoi, he left there in 1950 after the Communists confiscated family land during the redistribution program. He then left Saigon on April 20, 1975, just ahead of the advancing North Vietnamese Army, and he is explicit about his political views. ''I hate the Communists,'' he said.  Among the younger Vietnamese actors is Mr. Hoang, whose father left his mother and several brothers and sisters to join the Communist forces, eventually becoming the Secretary of Education for South Vietnam in the Communist Government from 1975 until his death this year. Mr. Hoang did not see his father after the age of 11.  'I Thought of My Father'  ''I cried at the audition,'' Mr. Hoang, who came alone to the United States shortly before the Communist victory, said. ''I thought of my father. My mother will never forgive him because he left his family behind.''  Mr. Hoang, while himself fervently anti-Communist, sees his father, a writer, as a reluctant soldier, driven out of Saigon because of his opposition to the American-supported Government. He thinks of him, he said, as a person reminiscent of the fictional guerrilla that he plays in Mr. Duncan's film.  For Joseph Hieu, a Vietnamese actor who came to The United States when he was 17, the difference between Mr. Duncan's script and his own experience is less bridgable than that of Mr. Hoang.  Mr. Hieu said he came from a commercial family whose property was confiscated by the Communists. He was forced to spend ''a long 10 days'' in a re-education center. He and his family left Vietnam as boat people nine months after the fall of Saigon.  ''I understand the point that this is a show about human beings,'' he said of ''The Last Soldier.'' ''But playing the part of the enemy, I am struggling within myself. I am portraying the enemy as having a heart that I have never encountered.''

"   , Calif., Aug. 21   A Vietnamese author who told interviewers three years ago about threats on his life was wounded seriously over the weekend by two men who opened fire on him as he walked near his home.  The writer, Doan Van Toai, 42 years old, was shot four times in the head and upper body Saturday, Sgt. Oliver Moon of the Sheriff's Department said. Mr. Toai was moved to an undisclosed location where Mr. Moon said his condition was serious.  Mr. Toai is a co-author of ''The Vietnamese Gulag'' and ''Portrait of the Enemy'' with David Chanoff. He is also executive director of the Institute for Democracy in Vietnam.  Latest of Several Attacks  The shooting was the latest attack in California in recent years against Vietnamese refugees who advocate that the United States establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam.  Mr. Toai said in a 1986 interview with The Los Angeles Times that an article he wrote exposing alleged fraud by an anti-Communist group provoked death threats.  ''I wrote an article in The Los Angeles Times saying these people who want to fight the Communist Government are collecting money for that cause but are actually using the money for themselves,'' Mr. Toai said in the interview.  Orange County Shootings  ''The group threatened to kill my whole family after the story ran,'' he said.  In 1986, a former Saigon housing official, Tran Khanh Van, was shot in Westminster in Orange County after he said he supported relations with Vietnam. His assailant pleaded guilty and was convicted. The Vietnamese author Long Vu suffered partial paralysis after a severe beating, also in Westminster, on April 30, 1988.  Last January, an arson fire destroyed a Garden Grove travel agency specializing in Vietnam tours. No suspects have been arrested in that incident or in the beating of Long Vu.  Some Vietnamese speculate that Mr. Toai was shot by anti-Communists who wanted to kill him because he proposed diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam, said Dam Phuong Tran, president of the Vietnamese Committee for Human Rights in Washington.  He said, however, the writer had enemies on the other end of the political spectrum, and conceded it was possible he was shot by Communist agents.  Mr. Toai was shot by two men described as Asian and driving a dirty brown Pontiac station wagon, Mr. Moon said.  Mr. Toai came to the United States as a refugee in 1978. ''He didn't try to escape from Vietnam,'' Mr. Tran said. ''As a student, he was a sympathizer of the National Liberation Front.''  ''A lot of Vietnamese accuse him of being a Communist agent,'' Mr. Tran said. ''I think of him as a Vietnamese who tried to do something good for the people of Vietnam and for the good of the country itself. That doesn't mean he agreed with the present political situation in Vietnam.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 22 1989 ,0
"    ANGELES, Aug. 24   Some of the last skirmishes of the Vietnam War are being fought, sometimes with words and occasionally with bullets, within the sharply fragmented Vietnamese refugee population of the United States.  One of the boldest and most controversial of the partisans, a writer named Doan Van Toai, was shot and seriously wounded Saturday on a quiet street in Fresno, sending tremors of fear through an emigre community that has already learned that speaking out can be dangerous.  Mr. Toai, a leading advocate of improving relations with the Communist Government of Vietnam, had managed to anger his fellow immigrants on both the right and the left, and although there are many theories, it is still unclear who shot him.  Mr. Toai, who is 43 years old, was listed in critical condition today in a hospital in the Fresno area after two Asian men in a dirty brown station wagon without license plates drew alongside him as he walked down a street and fired three shots into his head and back, the police said.  Tensions Expected to Increase  The attack was the latest of a number of incidents, many of them still unsolved, including shootings, arson, threats and mysterious suicides. A number of prominent Vietnamese said they routinely took precautionary measures as a result of these incidents.  Both Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese who are involved with emigre politics said they expected tensions and the possibility of violence to increase as the United States draws closer to establishing normal diplomatic and economic relations with Vietnam.  One journalist, Trang Tuong Nhu, compared the 800,000 Vietnamese refugees in the United States with Cuban immigrants, whom she characterized as clinging to an inflexible anti-Communist approach and hoping Washington would remain antagonistic toward the country they fled.  Speaking of the attack on Mr. Toai, Dam Phuong Tran, who heads a private group called the Committee for Human Rights in Vietnam, said: ''It might be from the extreme right. It might be from the extreme left. It might be the act of a madman.  ''What many in the Vietnamese community don't understand is that this is a free country, that Toai or anybody else has the freedom to express whatever they think.''  Opposition to Normal Relations  Mr. Toai's most insistent critics, and the grouping of factions who have been linked to most of the previous threats and acts of violence, are those on the right who oppose normalization of relations with Vietnam.  ''I suppose there is a list of five or six types of people that could have shot him, but the most likely candidate is what we call the ex-A.R.V.N. paratrooper crowd,'' said Douglas Pike, director of Indochina studies at the University of Cailfornia at Berkeley. The former paratroopers in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam have a reputation of being fiercely rightist.  In an immigrant population that includes a sizable proportion of former military men, he said, a peculiar geography has taken shape.  ''There are a lot of generals and officers in Washington, a lot of field grade, upper grade, officers either in Texas or in the Los Angeles area, and in the lower Bay area of San Francisco you tend to have enlisted men and sergeants,'' Mr. Pike said. ''As a result, emigre politics in the Washington area tends to be more subtle and sophisticated. In the San Francisco area it tends to be more direct.''  That area encircling San Francisco includes towns with concentrations of Southeast Asian refugees like Stockton, Merced and Fresno, where Mr. Toai was shot.  'Some Crazy Fanatics Around'  Groups of former South Vietnamese soldiers were believed to have been behind a series of threats against Mr. Toai over the years as he called for improved relations with Vietnam. After taking similar positions, seeking business arrangements with Vietnam, or traveling there, other Vietnamese have also been verbally attacked or threatened. Some have been killed.  ''There is a big fear going on in the community with some crazy fanatics around,'' said one Vietnamese involved with community affairs who did not give his name for fear of reprisal. ''There are fanatics who still believe that if they kill people and scare people off, if they try real hard, maybe they can influence the United States not to have diplomatic relations with Vietnam.''  Prominent figures killed in recent years include Dam Phong, the editor of a Vietnamese-language newspaper in Houston. Mr. Phong's killers left a note beside his body identifying themselves as the ''Vietnamese Party for the Annihilation of Communism and for the National Restoration.''  Tran Khanh Van, a prominent former official of the Saigon Government who lived in San Francisco, was shot and badly wounded in 1986.  A novelist, Long Vu, was partially paralyzed last year after a beating in an area called ''little Saigon'' in Westminster, just south of Los Angeles. A vocal defender of the Government in Hanoi, Nguyen Van Luy, was wounded and his wife was killed in a shooting on a street in San Francisco.  A California newspaper editor who wrote under the pen name Hoai Diep Tu died when his newspaper office was set afire. He had been criticized for printing advertisements for tours to Vietnam and had received death threats.  Two men who spoke out against Hoang Co Minh, an advocate of anti-Communist guerrilla warfare in Vietnam, died in mysterious apparent suicides in Texas, one by jumping from a freeway bridge and the other by hanging in his own closet.  The former South Vietnamese vice president, Nguyen Cao Ky, who has kept a low political profile as a businessman in Southern California, drew sharp criticism earlier this year for telling a conference of former officers that the time for fighting had ended.  Jane Fonda of the Vietnamese  Mr. Toai's background and style had caused suspicion and dislike, as well as admiration, from across the spectrum of the highly factionalized Vietnamese.  Mr. Pike called him the Jane Fonda of the Vietnamese community because of his approach and the passions it fueled.  A student at Saigon University in the late 1960's, Mr. Toai became a prominent figure advocating a non-Communist solution without American involvement. He became a bank manager in the coastal city of Qui Nhon and by his own later account had clandestine dealings with the Communist National Liberation Front. After the Communist victory in 1975, he became a member of the finance committee of the Government in the South, but protested the increasing dominance of the North as the country unified.  As a result, he was imprisoned for more than two years, but then secured a legal departure at a time when thousands of Vietnamese were risking their lives in dangerous escapes by boat.  Since coming to the United States, Mr. Toai has written three books, including a well-received study of the Vietnamese prison camp system and an one about the Communist military. He heads a political group called the Institute for Democracy in Vietnam.  Seen As an Opportunist  ''People from both the right and the left don't trust him and see him an opportunist,'' said Al Santoli, an author of books on Indochina who has shared public forums with Mr. Toai.  Matthew I. Chanoff, who is working with Mr. Toai on a history of the war, said, ''The main thing is that he believes that the Communist regime is a fact, and that we should negotiate with them and convince them that reform is in their best interests.''  Those are dangerous words among Vietnamese in America.  ''The thing you're not allowed to say in the Vietnamese community is that it is time for the United States and Hanoi to make up and to normalize relations,'' said Denis Rockstroh, a journalist who is married to a Vietnamese and who has monitored the pattern of violence. ''And when you do say it, bad things happen.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: photo of Doan Van Toai (AP)                      ",August 25 1989 ,0
"   , Thailand, Sept. 2   Vietnamese leaders have asserted that they falsified the date of Ho Chi Minh's death and changed portions of his will, putting the leader's body on display in a glass mausoleum when his initial wish was to be cremated.  The Vietnamese Communist Party leader, Nguyen Van Linh, issued a statement admitting to ''a number of problems regarding President Ho Chi Minh's testament and the day on which he died,'' the official Hanoi radio said on Thursday.  The statement said that because Ho's death, on Sept. 2, 1969, fell on Vietnam's National Day, the party leadership announced that he died a day later ''to prevent the date of Uncle Ho's death from coinciding with a day of great national rejoicing.''  Mr. Linh said a section of the will in which Ho requested that he be cremated was changed with his permission before his death in 1969. When he died, his body was embalmed and placed in a glass coffin displayed in a Soviet-style mausoleum in Hanoi, the statement said, ''so that compatriots nationwide, particularly the southern compatriots and international friends, might have a chance to visit the uncle.''

"    KONG, Sept. 2   In the second major refugee riot here in a week, a Vietnamese man was killed today and 11 others were injured during a disturbance that began with a dispute over a gambling debt. The riot reflected a growing tendency toward violence among the frustrated Vietnamese boat people crowded into Hong Kong's detention centers.  For the first time, British Army soldiers were called in to assist the police. The 30 soldiers searched for weapons in the Sek Kong detention center, the site of today's violence, where 7,000 boat people are housed in tents pitched along an asphalt runway belonging to the British Air Force. A Government spokesman said the soldiers used metal detectors to search for buried caches of homemade weapons.  Last Sunday, 1,000 Vietnamese rioted on the island of Tai A Chau, and despite the use of tear gas, the small contingent of police officers there were unable to restore order and was forced to withdraw from the island. After a night of assaults, robberies and five reported rapes, the island, where 5,500 Vietnamese were detained, was retaken when helicopters ferried in more than 350 riot police officers. Twelve arrests have been made, and one Vietnamese was charged with rape.  No Electricity, No Toilets  Tai A Chau, virtually uninhabited before the Vietnamese were moved there about three months ago, has no electricity, running water or toilets. The boat people there have been living in crumbling, abandoned village huts and makeshift tents, surrounded by piles of garbage and human feces.  Conditions there are so squalid that the Government said on Friday it could not control a recent cholera outbreak and would begin evacuating the island next week, increasing overcrowding, at least temporarily, in other camps.  Sixteen cases of cholera have been reported so far among people on the island. After a cleanup of Tai A Chau, and the construction of some crude housing, Vietnamese will again be housed there, officials said.  'Total Breakdown of Order'  The police said today's violence at the Sek Kong camp, which is in the rural New Territories area of the colony, began at 6 A.M. and raged for three hours as 200 boat people fought each other with sharpened tent pegs, water pipes, bottles and stones. Several hundred riot police officers were called in restore order, and 46 people were arrested.  ''What's happening inside these camps is a total breakdown of order,'' said a worker with a relief agency that deals with the Vietnamese. ''Normal controls are gone. Parents do not even control their children. People are hopeless and frightened. Tempers are frayed.''  Hong Kong is struggling to house and control more than 55,000 Vietnamese, only about 14,000 of whom are regarded as refugees and await resettlement in other countries. Hong Kong officials have said that Vietnamese who arrived after June 16, 1988, must prove they are fleeing religious or political persecution. Otherwise they remain jailed in prison-like detention centers until they can be returned to Vietnam.  According to Hong Kong officials, most of the Vietnamese crowding into Hong Kong are fleeing their country's grinding poverty.  Mandatory Repatriation  The Hong Kong Government has maintained that the only solution to the Vietnamese problem is the forced repatriation of the boat people. Sir David Wilson, the Governor, returned today from a meeting in London with Britain's Foreign Secretary and announced he hoped to reach an agreement with Hanoi on mandatory repatriation by the end of the year.  Over the summer, there have been scores of disturbances in the camps, with police officers and detainees suffering injuries. A police spokesman said there have been six slayings in the detention centers this year.  The police believe today's riot began when an argument broke out among Vietnamese who had gambled on the outcome of a camp volleyball game. They said that no one had come forward to identify the detainee killed during the violence.  After the riot, the police displayed hundreds of crude handmade weapons confiscated in the camp, including long metal tent pegs sharpened into knives.  Robert van Leeuwen, who runs the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees here, said that overcrowding and prolonged incarceration have made life inside the centers tense and volatile.  While acknowledging that Hong Kong has been forced to struggle with the huge task of feeding, housing and caring for tens of thousands of Vietnamese - 30,000 of whom arrived in the past year alone - relief agencies have recently criticized conditions inside the camps.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Sept. 19   The Vietnamese leadership has intensified a crackdown in ideological and intellectual life, warning against Western subversion in the language of the cold war.  Two recent speeches by the Communist Party General Secretary, Nguyen Van Linh, who is regarded as a reformer, profoundly disappointed and depressed some of his allies in this country's intellectual and journalistic elite.  They also raised concern among some prominent economists who have helped to draw up the changes, known here as renovation, that have begun to reduce the economic role of the state and to attract private capital and initiatives.  Concern Over Aid and Trade  They worry that in the absence of a comprehensive settlement in Cambodia, which the United States is now making a condition for improved relations with Vietnam, Hanoi's new defensiveness about the intentions of the West will further delay the aid and trade that it needs to salvage a rickety economy and provide jobs for a rapidly growing population.  Vietnam's withdrawal next week from Cambodia, which it invaded in December 1978, driving out the Government led by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, is now believed unlikely to lead to the United States' lifting its embargo on Vietnam. The embargo forestalls signficant investment and trade from other Western countries and has caused bitterness here.  At the same time, radical changes elsewhere in the Communist world - in China, the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary in particular - seem to have shocked the party leadership here and increased a sense of threat, insecurity and isolation.  Conservative voices that were muted during the first two years of Mr. Linh's rule, which began in December 1986, are now dominating debate only a little more than a year before Mr. Linh himself has said he will step down.  Some magazines and newspapers have been closed and some editors in chief, including To Hoa of Saigon Giai Phong, this city's most important paper, have been retired or replaced. Vu Kim Hanh, the 37-year-old editor of the newspaper Tuoi Tre, or Youth, which has written movingly of the country's social problems, is on a list of six editors to be dismissed, Vietnamese officials say privately, though for now she has retained her post.  ''I tell you frankly that we writers and poets are facing great difficulties,'' said a novelist who has spoken openly before. ''We do not want to speak of political problems, and please do not mention names, for this is Vietnam.''  An official said: ''The problem now is that there is no clear ideological line. It is very easy now to cross it. Being an editor now is a very dangerous job.''  Mr. Linh spoke to senior journalists here in March, encouraging them to emphasize positive accomplishments as well as ''negative phenomena,'' and he spoke out strongly against ''pluralism'' and multiparty democracy at the end of a party meeting on March 29.  In a speech here on Aug. 24 at the end of another party meeting, devoted to ideological questions, Mr. Linh accused the West, and in particular President Bush, of intervening in the internal affairs of Communist countries and trying to undermine them. He spoke of the ''escalating'' battle between the Communist camp and a fundamentally unchanged capitalist world, ''with its very insidious schemes and tricks.''  While apparently continuing to seek Western investment and encourage private enterprise here, he spoke harshly of an increasing exploitation of workers under capitalism, and said that modern technology, by increasing productivity, was robbing the worker of his ''surplus labor value by tens of time compared with a worker in the previous century.''  He also criticized ''some deviant ideological viewpoints among a handful of cadres and party members,'' which have been breeding amid ''the impact of wrong ideological currents coming from outside.''  ''This was a very clumsy speech,'' said a senior journalist here. ''It was the language of 45 years ago, and it depressed many people.''  A Vietnamese official said there had been only one vote against the speech in the Politburo, cast by Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, a Linh ally who did not attend the August party meeting due to illness.  It was Mr. Thach who had pressed for the early withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia to end Vietnam's economic and political isolation, and if the withdrawal does not produce some results, Mr. Thach's position will be jeopardized, the official said.  In a second speech Sept. 1, for Vietnam's national day on Sept. 2, Mr. Linh took up the same themes. He said Vietnam was prepared ''to broaden our external economic relations with all other countries, foreign companies and international organizations'' without political conditions, but he warned against ''the life style and decadent culture'' of the bourgeoisie and the West.
